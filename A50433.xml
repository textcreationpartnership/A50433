            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE DESIGNMENT AND NECESSARY USE OF THIS WORK.</head>
            <p>FEW there are that think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concerned in this train of dangerous diſeaſes; becauſe they judge themſelves clear at preſent, and do ſuppoſe theſe rarely to happen, for that they ſeldom hear of any to dye upon theſe accounts; and therefore do not imagine that ſuch ill Fate ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal them: but Feavers, Scurvy, Dropſies, Conſumption, or ſuch like common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes they expect to be their lot: but when you come to underſtand (as by the diſcovery following, you will plainly
<pb facs="tcp:49201:3"/>perceive) that few ſickneſſes or infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties you can fall into, if they be not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated in, or grounded upon ſome of theſe latent or lurking deſtroyers; yet there is a tendency towards them for a complication therewith, and their termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations therein as the laſt Scene; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the diſeaſe or ſickneſs be contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious, and of long continuance, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, dangerous, and mortal: ſo that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a true information, you will find ſuch probability to be ingaged here, when any infirm or ſickly ſtate ſhall alter your preſent healthful condition of body.</p>
            <p>And for ſuch as have already ſome warnings by pain, and a valetudinary ſtate, may ſeaſonably inquire, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult ſome ſagacious and ſolid Judgment, from whence it does ariſe, whither it tends, what progreſs probably it will make, if not prevented; a reſolve upon the queſtion very likely will fix here, if the caſe be throughly examined, and duly ſearcht into.</p>
            <p>Conſidering that pain moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:49201:3"/>either ariſeth from ſome of theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begun to act their parts; or that ſome of them will moſt likely follow thereupon, although veiled under the covering of a more known and familiar Diſeaſe; as fully declared in the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Diſcourſe: for whether the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Diſeaſe afflicting be the Scurvy, Conſumption, Dropſie, Ague, Spleen, Pox, or other chronic Diſeaſe; very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it falls out (though ſeldom taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of) that ſome of this train is compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and joyned therewith, if good Medicines or great Providence ſtop not the progreſs. And if the ſickneſs be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, malign, peſtilential, or other; as ſmall Pox, ſpotted Feavers, Plague, or any general <hi>Phlogoſis</hi> and febrile ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtemper; they come on common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Inflammation in ſome particular part, and proceed on to tumifie, apoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and gangrene, when ſuch a diſeaſe is not checkt, but grows deſperate, and becomes fatal to the ſick: and thus Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies, Angina's, Peripneumonia's, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations
<pb facs="tcp:49201:4"/>of the Brain, Ventricle, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Spleen, Meſentery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they go on in this road, by theſe ſtages and tranſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from Inflammation to Tumor, and ſo forward, finiſhing the courſe with a Gangrene and Mortification, if good means take not good effect to prevent and ſtop the progreſs.</p>
            <p>Obſerving therefore in conſtant Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, the frequency, latency, and danger of this aſſociation and confederate train, diſguiſed and couched under ſome more appearing and known diſeaſe; I thought it a Work neceſſary and grateful to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask and lay open ſuch ſecret deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that in the deſignments and methods of Cure, they may ſtrictly be ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and aimed at, thereby preventing the danger threatned, and ſecuring the Patient.</p>

            <head>THE ORDER, AND DEPENDENCE OF <hi>Pains, Inflammations, Tumors,</hi> &amp;c. internal; cautioning their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and complication.</head>
            <p>THE natural <hi>oeconomy</hi> and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of humane Bodies, may well be compared to a body <hi>Politick,</hi> ſubjected to State-diſcipline, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Conformity: the former hath a regular courſe inſtituted and implanted, by Nature; the latter hath Laws impoſed and injoyned by humane Authority to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>In both theſe <hi>Governments</hi> ſo long as Order and Laws are obeyed and kept, the whole is preſerved ſound, ſafe, and in quietneſs: but when the ſubjected parts of either do mutiny, rebel, and ſhake off the <hi>Government,</hi> refuſing to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49201:6"/>act in their ſtations and ſubſerviency; the whole then is put into diſorder, the union of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is broken, and the publick ſafety endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereby.</p>
            <p>If a <hi>part</hi> of the body decline its office and performance of duty, acts perverſly and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately; the miſchief ſtops not there, but other <hi>parts</hi> alſo are perverted thereby, and drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conſent: likewiſe if one <hi>Member</hi> of State be ſick of tranquillity and peace, be diſturbed at the Government, and begins to be diſſenting, diſobedient or mutinous, ten to one but this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection begets another of the ſame mind, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the <hi>ſecond</hi> makes a <hi>third,</hi> and thus the malignity ſpreads.</p>
            <p>When any <hi>part</hi> of the body begins to fail and be out of order, it ſeldom ſtops at its firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of declenſion, but makes a progreſs from <hi>bad</hi> to <hi>worſe,</hi> if not remedied and prevented: So a Member of State begins to be diſtempered, firſt with <hi>diſcontent,</hi> afterwards <hi>anger</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> ariſeth; and after that perhaps <hi>Rebellion</hi> follows, if fear of miſcarriage do not choak and deterr the Plot.</p>
            <p>If a <hi>finger</hi> akes, you will not be much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; but if the <hi>Head</hi> be pained, or ſick at <hi>Heart,</hi> you then conſider of ſeeking remedy, as not able to bear the trouble, or run the hazard: So if a mean inconſiderable man be diſorderly, contemptuous and drunken, little notice is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thereof, as to the publick detriment and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury: but if a <hi>great States</hi>-man or <hi>Magiſtrate</hi>

            <p>As the <hi>member</hi> is in office, dignity and power, greater or leſs, the care, inſpection and regard thereto is to be had accordingly, being of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or leſs concern; and yet no <hi>part</hi> ſo mean as to be contemned or ſlighted, for a pain but in the <hi>Toe,</hi> may <hi>tumifie, inflame</hi> and <hi>gangrene,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering the whole body; and a Fiſher-man of <hi>Naples,</hi> beginning but with a Tumult of Boys, thereby ſubverted the Government, and uſurpt the Power.</p>
            <p>But to quit the <hi>Analogie</hi> and proſecute di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly the ſubject propoſed; here is firſt <hi>Pain</hi> which moſt commonly is the leader; a ſignal or warning of a defection or diſturbance in the part where it is ſeated; which although ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it vaniſheth and comes to nothing, yet it is not ſo always, but often otherwiſe; for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the continuance in a remiſs and low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, or by ſpeedy advancing to extremity, it uſhers in other conſequents of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fear, and ſometimes <hi>fatal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>greateſt</hi> Diſeaſes have <hi>ſmall</hi> beginnings and ſeemingly contemptible; yet by time and neglect, or by unfit and improper means, or management, they arrive to a <hi>formidable</hi> height, and become mortal. <hi>Obſta principiis</hi> is good counſel; the beginnings of evil are to be checkt, leſt they grow too big to be maſtered and become irremediable.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49201:7"/>
            <p>If <hi>pain</hi> ſeize a part here or there, you know not what will follow, nor by what gradual ſteps it will advance, what progreſs it will make, and what the iſſue and event of all.</p>
            <p>If <hi>pain</hi> begins, <hi>Inflammation</hi> or <hi>Tumor</hi> or both may follow, and perhaps not ſtop there, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept prevented by a prudent courſe to obviate the miſchief.</p>
            <p>And further, if a <hi>part</hi> or member be diſabled, or put out of its office and the rectitude of its function by <hi>pain</hi> and <hi>anguiſh,</hi> the detriment does not reſt here only, but other parts are drawn into conſent, they fare the worſe for it, and by time the whole is become a ſufferer and made ſenſible of that prejudice. And every ones experience by the death or long languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſeaſes. of their Relations, Friends or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance can teſtifie this truth; how ſmall their complaints were at firſt, what little appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance their infirmities did make, how unſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>progreſs,</hi> and ſuch an <hi>event,</hi> or the arrival to ſuch a height how unexpected; and therefore not ſo timely, not ſo prudently and carefully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to for help and remedy.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſmall</hi> pain begins, <hi>greater</hi> comes on, and that's a ground-work for <hi>Inflammation,</hi> and this moſt likely to beget a <hi>Tumor,</hi> which if not diſcuſſed in time, and the anguiſh of the <hi>Archae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> or vital principle appeaſed, a <hi>ſcirrhous</hi> hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is fixed there, <hi>cancerous</hi> or otherwiſe; or it degenerates into purulent matter and <hi>apoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates:</hi> it ſtays not long in that capacity, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49201:7"/>it breaks forth and preſents you with an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer,</hi> if the place be in view; but if not, and the part affected be internal and hid, then there will be a diſcovery or diſcharge of matter by ſome Emunctory or common vent, or ſudden death muſt finiſh the courſe: thus every Scene more tragical, threatning and more dangerous than other.</p>
            <p>True it is, that Nature by her own ſtruggling and endeavors does quit her ſelf ſometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſſiſtance and help, and ſtops the courſe and progreſs of a diſeaſe; but this is hazardous to truſt to or rely upon; and Providence uſually works not <hi>wonders</hi> but where the <hi>means</hi> is wanting: your preſumption therefore and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect may juſtly be chaſtiſed with a ſmarting ſenſe of what you ſlighted, and your contempt of means puniſhed with the loſs of that, which others by good means do frequently obtain.</p>
            <p>As Nature is regular, and obſerves her order and courſe in a ſtate of integrity; ſo likewiſe in a <hi>preternatural</hi> ſtate of defection, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Method and Series, or a gradual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs from one diſeaſe to another, or a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of diſeaſes <hi>gradatim</hi> brought and linked together; that a ſagacious foreſighted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Phyſician, ſeeing one diſeaſe to preſent it ſelf, looks beyond that, takes a farther proſpect, and diſcovers the train that will follow, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing their <hi>connexion</hi> and <hi>dependence</hi> upon each other; and there is much reaſon for it: for, as the parts and members conſent and comply with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49201:8"/>each other in <hi>ſanity</hi> and a ſtate of health; ſo likewiſe the members do complain, condole and ſuffer with each other, and become partners in <hi>diſorder,</hi> infirmity and a <hi>morbous</hi> ſtate: for the members having a mutual commerce, ſupply and help one from another, of neceſſity then if one be out of order and defective, the other will be diſordered thereby, wanting the aſſiſtance of its fellow and conſort in the common work.</p>
            <p>As every part of the body labours to ſupport it ſelf; ſo each endeavors by the <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>office</hi> impoſed by Nature, to maintain the ſociety and harmony of the whole <hi>Corporation:</hi> for every part hath ſuch dependence upon, and relation to each other in the common ſafety, that the good of one is the benefit of another, and the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of one redound to the prejudice of the reſt; and as the part is more <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi> in office, the ſooner is the whole made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of its grief; and a ſingle <hi>Malady</hi> becomes the common <hi>calamity,</hi> and a publick evil.</p>
            <p>But to come yet cloſer to the matter in hand, and to illuſtrate this <hi>Series</hi> of Diſeaſes, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject propoſed in the front of this Work; and that you may know how common this caſe is in practice, how rarely diſcovered, and therefore erroneouſly adjudged, and the <hi>fatal</hi> conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof; which to handle the more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearly, and to prove more convincingly and unanſwerably, I ſhall part my Diſcourſe into three diviſions, and raiſe Arguments under theſe three <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> compriſing the whole ſtory of our deſign.</p>

               <item>1. That this Series of <hi>Pain, Inflammation, Tumor,</hi> &amp;c. is very common, and the moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent train of mortal Diſeaſes incident to mans body.</item>

            </list>
            <p>To ſet forth and make evident the truth of our firſt <hi>Poſition,</hi> you muſt know that <hi>Pain</hi> is commonly the firſt <hi>Symptom</hi> of moſt diſeaſes; and if it does not appear as a leader, yet very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it comes in <hi>early,</hi> or ſoon after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe hath diſcovered it ſelf; and few that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of ſickneſs, but complain of ſome <hi>pain</hi> that attends it, and this our Practice muſt owne and confirm: and taking a ſurvey of the Catalogue of Diſeaſes belonging to mans Body, you will find no Symptom ſo frequently adjoyned and appertaining to them, as that of <hi>pain;</hi> and the reaſon hereof in part may be this: That all the Symptoms of diſeaſes are the objects of <hi>ſenſe;</hi> that is, they do come under, or are diſcernable by ſome of the <hi>ſenſes;</hi> which being compared
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49201:9"/>amongſt themſelves, are of greater and leſſer la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: now <hi>pain</hi> belongs to, and is adjudged by the ſenſe of <hi>feeling</hi> only; which ſenſe is of the largeſt capacity of all the reſt; being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended throughout the body, even through the <hi>Organs</hi> of all the other ſenſes; whereas the reſt are confined to particular parts, the <hi>Eye,</hi> the <hi>Ear,</hi> &amp;c. and have no larger extent or place of reſidence, (as hereafter we ſhall have further oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to diſcourſe.) For inſtance; <hi>ſeeing</hi> may diſcover what is amiſs upon the <hi>external</hi> parts or ſuperficies of the body, and diſcern what comes forth, that it may be adjudged; but <hi>feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> takes cogniſance of inſide and outſide, and what we cannot <hi>ſee</hi> we <hi>feel,</hi> and are ſenſible of by <hi>pain,</hi> even amongſt the moſt ſecret and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den parts of the body: ſo that <hi>pain</hi> is known to be, and does manifeſt it ſelf, whether it be within, or without. Hence it is, that <hi>pain</hi> is the moſt uſual and moſt frequent Symptom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pain</hi> therefore belonging to this capacious ſenſe, and being an appertainer thereto, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving admiſſion into all its quarters and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines; no wonder then if <hi>pain</hi> ſo frequently oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs, and is the moſt uſual attendant, or moſt troubleſom intruder upon the ſick.</p>
            <p>Having thus proved (and might farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, if needful) that <hi>pain</hi> is the moſt general and frequent complaint of the diſeaſed; we ſhall proceed and inquire farther, how <hi>Tumors, Inflammations,</hi> &amp;c. do follow thereupon, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49201:9"/>how <hi>pain</hi> introduceth and uſhers in the reſt of its fellows, and how <hi>pain</hi> is introduced ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by them; and how they appear very often with their conſorts, having <hi>relation</hi> to and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence</hi> upon each other by way of cauſation; that ſome of them, and ſometimes all, are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Actors in the Tragedy of moſt mortal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, though ſeldom diſcerned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mortal</hi> diſeaſes I ſaid; becauſe where diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are ſtopt in their progreſs, and have not their full courſe, but are taken off by effectual means, or great <hi>Providence,</hi> the links of this chain is broken, and then perhaps <hi>pain</hi> may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe its power ſingly and alone for a time, and by intervals; or <hi>pain</hi> may contract or aſſociate a <hi>Tumor,</hi> and ſometimes an <hi>Inflammation,</hi> and yet all end well; theſe may go off, or be ſent off by Medicine, and proceed no farther, and the Patient recover, or return to a good and ſound ſtate of Health: but too often it proves other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, either by neglect and delay, by improper methods and erroneous proceeding, or for want of exquiſite means, the progreſs goes on gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the laſt, and ends with <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this train of Diſeaſes, <hi>pain</hi> for the moſt part is a <hi>leader,</hi> and ſometimes a <hi>follower;</hi> but ſeldom miſſeth to be the <hi>diſcoverer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pain</hi> begins and gives the Alarm, diſcovering a diſorder or diſeaſe in this or that internal and hidden part of the body; gives warning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and implores aid: but none coming, at leaſt not ſufficient and effectual, the <hi>pain</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49201:10"/>as the cauſe is yet remaining: if the help of Art be wanting, yet Nature is not wanting to her ſelf, but ſummoneth all her power and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to diſlodge and expel this morbific cauſe, and raiſeth all her Spirits, though in a <hi>febrile</hi> diſturbance and confuſion, againſt this common enemy: to the part <hi>grieved</hi> theſe Spirits reſort plentifully, and with them the blood is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which flowing in and remaining there, a <hi>Tumor</hi> is generated, and by this concourſe of Spirits the part grows fiery, and an <hi>Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is planted here and ſuperadded.</p>
            <p>The caſe remaining thus for a while, and this confluence not diſperſed, diſcuſſed or drawn off; the <hi>Tumor</hi> perhaps grows <hi>cancerous,</hi> afterwards <hi>gangrenes</hi> and <hi>mortifies,</hi> then death immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enſues and concludes all.</p>
            <p>But ſometimes the Tumor <hi>ſuppurates</hi> or <hi>apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemates;</hi> and then the contained purulent matter breaks forth and begets an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer,</hi> if the Patient ſurvive and hold it out: and with this the diſeaſed may continue a longer or ſhorter time, according to the nature of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer,</hi> and as it is more or leſs dangerouſly ſeated: for if it be a principal part, or adjacent; or this <hi>ulcerous</hi> matter iſſuing, falls into ſome inconvenient ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity where it is lodged again, and finds no <hi>Emun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory</hi> or paſſage out, or erodes and rots ſome choice veſſel of great uſe, the caſe is deplorable, and ſcarce remediable.</p>
            <p>Now to comment a little upon this ſeries and progreſs, conſider that where there is pain, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49201:10"/>it continues, eſpecially in a high degree, you may rationally expect a Tumor, or flux of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors congregated to be the conſequent (if not prevented) which is brought to paſs and effected after this manner, or upon a threefold account.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe Nature in a time of exigence and need, does endeavor to help her ſelf, and exerts her power to the utmoſt; and therefore when <hi>pain</hi> afflicts a member, the <hi>Spirits</hi> reſort thither, and with them the <hi>blood</hi> alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The part pained by reaſon of this <hi>plenitude</hi> of blood and confluence of <hi>Spirits,</hi> does wax hot, and this heat begets an attraction, and draws more humors to the part.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Pain</hi> debilitates and diſables the part, whereby it is become uncapable to defend it ſelf, but lyes obnoxious to this flux of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, which being out of their proper place, and remaining in a diſtempered part, they degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate variouſly.</p>
            <p>Now upon a ſurvey of the whole matter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Nature intends well in this <hi>hurry</hi> and <hi>buſtle,</hi> being rouzed up and pricked by <hi>pain</hi> (and ſucceſs ſometimes happens upon it, or no damage) yet commonly it falls out otherwiſe, and there is an <hi>oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>over-charge</hi> brought upon the part: The confluence of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits together with the innate, tumultuate and inflame the grieved member; which being thus diſcompoſed and out of order, cannot moderate and check the flux and attraction of humors,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49201:11"/>but is over-loaded, crowded therewith, and diſtended: And unleſs the help of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by a prudent hand, ſteps in to appeaſe and allay this diſturbance, by caſting out the <hi>morbific ſeminary</hi> or matter, and reduce this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, it goes on from bad to worſe frequently, and from thence to <hi>extremity,</hi> and perhaps to an <hi>irrecoverable</hi> ſtate , in manner and by ſuch gradations as before related.</p>
            <p>And beſides what <hi>pain</hi> does thus effect as a leader; <hi>Tumors</hi> ſometimes do take their riſe not from <hi>pain,</hi> but either by <hi>congeſtion,</hi> or a congeſted matter in an infirm part, be it never ſo ſmall, if noxious and preternatural, it is ſufficient to be the ground-work of all this miſchief: or elſe ſometimes by <hi>defluxion,</hi> from ſome part <hi>mandant;</hi> in both which caſes pain follows as a conſequent and effect; (as hereafter more at large) but then <hi>Tumor</hi> and <hi>pain</hi> being thus met together, the progreſs will go on as before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now in the ſame road as formerly, when pain preceded. And although pain does not begin to raiſe a <hi>Tumor,</hi> but the foundation is laid by congeſted matter there bred, or deflux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and tranſmitted thither from ſome other part; yet <hi>rarely</hi> but <hi>pain</hi> ſupervenes, and comes in as an aſſociate to haſten and ſet forward the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor:</hi> for matter congeſted or defluxed, is inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and a burden upon a part, and then the vital principle or <hi>Archaeus</hi> (which hath the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and tuition) is moleſted and troubled therewith, and ſeldom lyes calm or quiet under
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49201:11"/>that oppreſſion, but begins to be incenſed and enraged (more or leſs, <hi>pro magnitudine cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>) and this <hi>ira Archaei</hi> is the <hi>ratio formalis</hi> of pain, the very pain it ſelf which is felt.</p>
            <p>By the whole current of our Diſcourſe you ſee, and by your own experience you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that <hi>pain</hi> is moſt frequent with infirm and diſeaſed bodies; ſo likewiſe it is apparent to reaſon, and experience confirms it, That <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, Inflammations,</hi> &amp;c. will often follow thereupon as dependants thence: and <hi>è contrà</hi> pain does ſupervene and follow preternatural <hi>Tumors.</hi> And we ſee commonly that <hi>external pains</hi> continuing, do produce a <hi>Tumor</hi> or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtention of the part, at leaſt is coadjuvant or concomitant: after the ſame manner, and by the ſame way of cauſation, <hi>internal Tumors</hi> are bred alſo, and we cannot in reaſon imagine other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: for the courſe of diſeaſes, having the ſame <hi>radix,</hi> and taking their riſe after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, are alike internal and external; for as pain begets a Tumor externally and in view, ſo doth it produce the like effect, and makes the ſame progreſs in the interior and hidden parts.</p>
            <p>And thus much may ſuffice to prove and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm our firſt <hi>Theſis</hi> or Poſition, and to ſatisfie the rational and unbyaſſed, of that truth. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed now to the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> That this progreſs and complication of <hi>Pains, Tumors,</hi> &amp;c. are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom determined and adjudged aright, except they preſent outwards and are diſcerned by the eye.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:49201:12"/>
            <p>And having remarkt the <hi>frequency</hi> of this <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> among the ſick and diſeaſed, and its manner of progreſs; we ſhall now take notice how ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom it is lookt upon and judged for the caſe in practice, but ſuppoſed to be ſomething elſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til <hi>diſſection</hi> ſometimes informs their judgment, when too late.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> diſcovery of this miſtake, and the argument drawn from thence ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, is from the <hi>aims</hi> of the Phyſician, the <hi>Method</hi> and Courſe of Phyſick, and <hi>adaptation</hi> of Medicines; which being levelled quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the <hi>mark,</hi> does plainly ſhew, that this <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of Diſeaſes is not thought of, when they lye but ſeemingly obſcure, internally; as very <hi>frequently</hi> they do, when diſeaſes run to ſome height of ſeverity, having no check or ſtop put upon them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> diſcovery or <hi>conviction</hi> of error (when too late) is from diſſection after death, and is plain demonſtration to the eye: as when Relations are not ſatisfied concerning the death of the Patient; and the Phyſician dubiouſly or unſatisfactorily giving in the account; diſſection lays open, and preſents to view a <hi>Tumor</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, rottenneſs</hi> or <hi>putrid</hi> decay of the part, <hi>gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grened</hi> or <hi>mortified;</hi> which makes evident what before was little thought of. Now upon ſuch miſcarriage indemnification is thus framed with a <hi>ſalvo judicio:</hi> that when the <hi>Corps</hi> bears any of theſe characters, the account is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in, as plain to be ſeen, that the Patient
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49201:12"/>was in ſuch a deſperate condition, as it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to <hi>retrive</hi> or recover; and ſo the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh is wip't off the Phyſician, and he paſſes for an <hi>able</hi> man as before; when indeed this fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral concluſion was brought about for want of a <hi>previſion,</hi> true notion and due apprehenſion of this frequent progreſs of diſeaſes (our ſubject) which might have been prevented or ſtopt, if the deſign of Cure had lookt that way.</p>
            <p>Now the grand occaſion of paſſing over and hiding this Series or commutation from Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, does ariſe chiefly from the erroneous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the general diviſion of Diſeaſes; <hi>viz.</hi> ranking all Diſeaſes under theſe three Heads.</p>

The diſeaſed perſon being made ſenſible hereof, that he is <hi>hotter</hi> or <hi>colder,</hi> &amp;c. than formerly, is well ſatisfied that the Phyſician hath hit it right; and this diſtemper being a grand one, muſt father all or moſt of the other ail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as the off-ſpring from thence; ſo that getting but the maſtery of this, all will be well.</p>
            <p>The <hi>organical</hi> Diſeaſes <hi>internal,</hi> being more difficult to be detected, are paſſed over as <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure;</hi> at leaſt the diſquiſition is not ſufficient, inſiſting too much, and relying upon the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a diſeaſe or diſtemper in the <hi>firſt</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diviſion; that what pain there is here or there, it paſſeth for <hi>wind,</hi> or <hi>obſtructions</hi> in the part. And as for the <hi>third rank,</hi> it is rarely thought of, except ſomething preſent out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>All which does appear from the endeavours of Practice, which more eſpecially and moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently do aim at, and are bent againſt diſeaſes of the <hi>firſt Claſſis:</hi> ſome of which are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable in the deſign of Curing, as not to be lookt upon for diſeaſes, but only <hi>Characters</hi> and <hi>Signals</hi> following and depending upon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes <hi>per accidens;</hi> with whom they appear in ſuch degree, and vaniſh again, as diſeaſes do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or decreaſe, and go off.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49201:13"/>
            <p>To contract our Diſcourſe into as little room as we can, and yet to prove our aſſertions clearly; I ſhall pitch upon one diſtemper only, <hi>intemperies calida,</hi> a hot conſtitution, a <hi>febrile</hi> heat or Feaver; the prime and notable diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the firſt rank, which makes the great <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> in Practice, though to little, or bad purpoſe, (and by this you may judge of the errour and folly of the reſt:) for by inſiſting ſo much upon this <hi>heat,</hi> the ſuppoſed obſtacle of Cure, or the <hi>thing</hi> to be cured; the opportunity perhaps may be loſt; but the Patient certainly injured by the vain uſe of Medicines levelled at this mark.</p>
            <p>Few diſeaſes there are amongſt the <hi>Chronic</hi> or ſlow of motion, but ſome <hi>febrile</hi> or preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural heat, (more than the ordinary and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural temper) does attend them; eſpecially at ſuch times, if the diſeaſe have any manifeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of degrees, or <hi>Paroxyſms</hi> of pain: and ſcarce any among the <hi>acute</hi> or ſwift, but a brisk and high Feaver does always accompany: for in all caſes where <hi>pain</hi> is continuing, eſpecially if ſevere, a Feaver is adjoyned, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>fratres in malo;</hi> or rather a branch from that ſtock, and the order of cauſation runs thus.</p>
            <p>Firſt, there is the <hi>morbific</hi> cauſe <hi>planted</hi> in this or that part, or <hi>tranſient;</hi> which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome degenerate or peccant humor there infeſting, or corruptive ſeminary (the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental matter of <hi>Pains, Tumors,</hi> &amp;c.) or ſome

Theſe preternatural cauſes do ſeldom lye dormant but raiſe pain, by <hi>obſtruction,</hi> by <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> or <hi>compreſſion,</hi> by <hi>convulſion, diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, corroſion, putrefaction,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The parts being thus affected and grieved, the <hi>vital</hi> principle reſiding as governor there, is hereby excited and irritated, to remove, expel and caſt off the offending cauſe: this <hi>ſtrugling</hi> and <hi>irritation</hi> of the life, is the very pain and anguiſh that is felt in the part; for the <hi>Organ</hi> is not capable of pain, of it ſelf; but the <hi>life</hi> inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting and inabling the part to perform vital offices, that does <hi>dolere</hi> and <hi>aeſtuare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now a <hi>Feaver</hi> (which is <hi>pain</hi> diffuſed) ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from particular <hi>pains</hi> thus; As the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or parts of the body being many, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with one another, ſome more immediately and peculiarly, than with the reſt, by veſſels of communication, partnerſhip in office or vicini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet the <hi>life</hi> being one <hi>entity</hi> or common being, extended and expanded throughout the whole fabrick of the body, cannot ſuffer here or there, but the <hi>whole</hi> is injured, diſturbed and drawn into conſent, more or leſs, manifeſtly or ſecretly; and the <hi>Spirits</hi> (upon great occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) are raiſed up in commotion throughout the body, as <hi>inſtruments</hi> to vindicate the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick from an enemy invading.</p>
            <p>And farther, take notice that <hi>particular</hi> pains beget (the <hi>general</hi>) a Feaver greater or leſs , ſooner or flower, upon a double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>

            </list>
            <p>For example; Sickneſs (which is pain) at the <hi>Heart,</hi> or <hi>Stomach,</hi> raiſeth a Feaver great, and ſoon; and this by reaſon of the excellency and neceſſity of their offices, whereby the whole body conſents forthwith; that what afflicts theſe, is a general complaint more immediately: but other <hi>parts</hi> in a lower ſtation, <hi>ſubſervient</hi> and <hi>miniſterial,</hi> whoſe function being not ſo general, but of particular and private uſe, do not communicate their diſeaſes ſo ſoon; nor the whole body ſo highly reſenting their ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, becauſe the publick can ſpare their offices, and be without their exquiſite or compleat aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for a time, without great complaint, or manifeſt want.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the cauſe or morbific matted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greater or leſs in any part, does thereby affect more or leſs, ſooner or later: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>ſand,</hi> or ſmall <hi>gravel</hi> in the <hi>Kidneys,</hi> do not afflict the part, nor raiſe ſo great a diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in the body, as a <hi>ſtone</hi> there, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs the <hi>ducture,</hi> and ſtops the current of the Urine, and is much more difficult to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And ſickneſs or pain at the <hi>Stomach,</hi> by little over-drinking of good liquor, Wine or Beer, &amp;c. is not ſo laſting, nor moleſting, nor preading in the effects over the whole body; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s a ſurfeit of <hi>meat, fruit,</hi> or an over-charge of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49201:15"/>bad liquors; theſe ſhall produce not only ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or pain in the ſtomach, but ſickneſs or a hot pain in the whole body, which is called a <hi>Feaver;</hi> and this ſickneſs may be dangerous, as ſometimes it proves mortal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pain</hi> is fixed in one part, but the <hi>Feaver</hi> is univerſal, ſpread throughout the body; for from this pain of a particular part, the whole life eſtuates, is incenſed and diſquieted: as if a cord be tyed or faſtned at both ends, of great length and ſtrait; ſtrike it hard in one place, and it jarrs the whole length; but at the place ſtruck, the vibration is greater and more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt: So where the diſeaſe is ſeated, the <hi>pain</hi> is more apparent, and that part moſt ſenſible: where the <hi>wound</hi> is given, where the <hi>oppreſſion</hi> lyes, where the <hi>obſtruction</hi> is where the humor is <hi>corroding, putrifying,</hi> &amp;c. there pain is <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenter;</hi> limited or bounded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to be pointed at particularly, here and not there eminently: but from hence ariſeth the <hi>Feaver,</hi> which is pain diffuſed, in a remiſs degree, and ſeemingly of another nature or quality, a different thing ſuppoſed by ſome, therefore denominated a <hi>Feaver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Feaver,</hi> although it be a <hi>pain,</hi> yet it is not ſo felt by the Patient, nor ſo underſtood by others, becauſe of the greater particular pain that drowned it; and becauſe of its expanſion and latitude, all parts bearing their proportion and ſhare; ſo that where a <hi>Feaver</hi> ſtands alone without a particular pain in this or that part;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49201:15"/>yet the Feaver, the general pain, is not ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to the ſenſe of the Patient, becauſe every part hath its portion, and therefore is not ſo diſcernable and uneaſie: for a Feaver is pain expatiated through the body, and you are not ſo ſenſible of it, as when pain is contracted into a narrow compaſs, the reſt being free and at eaſe.</p>
            <p>That all <hi>Feavers</hi> are <hi>pains,</hi> greater or leſs, examine but the definitions of <hi>Febris,</hi> and that of <hi>Dolor,</hi> Feaver and pain, you will be fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed how they agree; a Feaver being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed under pain, as a <hi>Species</hi> of that <hi>Genus,</hi> being a hot pain, or the pain of heat.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Dolor eſt triſtis ſenſatio in tactu.</p>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>Gal.</hi>
               </bibl>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Febris eſt calor contra naturam in corde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſus, &amp; ex eo in totum corpus diffuſus,</hi> which is <hi>Hippocratic</hi> and <hi>Galenic</hi> Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Now where there is heat, higher or exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is natural, it muſt affect the ſenſe of feeling and cauſe pain: and although I do not like the definition of <hi>Febris,</hi> yet it will ſerve my turn here, being right, in the opinion of thoſe Galeniſts with whom I now contend.</p>
            <p>From hence we muſt underſtand (and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught again) that <hi>Dolor</hi> and <hi>Febris</hi> do differ as <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>ſpecies;</hi> a Feaver being contained under, and is one ſort of pain, <hi>viz.</hi> a hot ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching pain; and ſometimes a Feaver is a cold pain, as the rigor of intermitting Feavers (called <hi>Agues</hi>) do teſtifie. And ſince that all <hi>Feavers</hi> we <hi>pains</hi> little or great, we ſhall not need to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49201:16"/>inſtitute a Method of Cure different upon the notion of a Feaver; but only having reſpect unto the cauſe that raiſeth this feaveriſh or hot pain: and therefore <hi>Feavers</hi> are to be cured as other <hi>pains</hi> are; that is, by adapting Medicines to remove the morbific matter or cauſe of pain, and not otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>And here by the way I muſt obſerve the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and miſtake of Authors, diſtinguiſhing Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers into <hi>eſſential</hi> and <hi>ſymptomatical,</hi> whereas no Feavers are <hi>eſſential,</hi> but all dependent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome diſeaſe, morbific Miaſm or ſeminary, and is a <hi>Symptom</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p>Where the ſeminary or morbific cauſe is fixed or ſeated, there is particular pain <hi>eminenter</hi> to be pointed at; and there is a febrile or infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming heat, occaſioned by this <hi>Spina,</hi> thorn in the fleſh, which provokes the vital principle to eſtuation: this <hi>heat</hi> is carried and ſpread more remote, and conveyed by the venal and arterial current through the whole body; ſo that this pain being ſpread or ſcattered, loſeth its denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of pain, and then takes up the title of a <hi>Feaver:</hi> (as Tradition will have it) which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes moſt <hi>Practiſers,</hi> thinking now they have ſome new thing to deal with, and another diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe: when indeed <hi>Dolor</hi> and <hi>Febris</hi> do not differ at that rate; and we may ſay , that pain is a Feaver <hi>contracted;</hi> a Feaver is pain <hi>diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now whereas it is vulgarly ſaid ſometimes, that the Patient hath no <hi>pain,</hi> but only ſick at
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49201:16"/>the <hi>Heart,</hi> or the <hi>Stomach;</hi> this is very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and cannot truly be ſaid; for <hi>Stomach</hi>-ſickneſs or <hi>Heart</hi>-ſickneſs is nothing but pain and anguiſh of thoſe parts, which is <hi>triſtis ſenſatio in tactu;</hi> it is feeling that makes you ſenſible of ſickneſs at the Heart or Stomach, and by no other ſenſe; and this is pain, but different from other pains, by reaſon of the <hi>Organ</hi> differing from the reſt in ſtructure and office; and alſo from their cauſes, which makes theſe ſick pains to be various and different in themſelves: So that all <hi>ſickneſs</hi> of this nature and kind, is <hi>pain,</hi> tending towards and bringing on this Series of Diſeaſes, the ſubject and deſign of our Diſcourſe: but in regard theſe ſickneſſes are often taken off, and checkt, the progreſs is prevented, and it goes no farther than the attempt.</p>
            <p>And farther, the reaſon why theſe ſick <hi>pains</hi> do not produce and bring forth <hi>Tumors, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations,</hi> &amp;c. more frequently in the parts where they are ſeated, is becauſe the humor or matter offending is not always fixed in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchyma,</hi> fleſhy ſubſtance of the member or any ſolid containing part thereof; but floating in ſome veſſel or cavity; ſo that having no root and ſolid foundation, it cannot form a Tumor otherwiſe than by <hi>obſtruction</hi> and <hi>diſtention</hi> of the cavous part; having no ſeminary for aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation planted in the ſubſtance of the Organ. But this may happen, as ſometimes it doth, that any ſharp <hi>ſeroſity,</hi> or eroding putrid matter, may excoriate the concave ſuperficies of any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49201:17"/>veſſel or cavity of a member, planting an Ulcer there, which may produce ſad effects, and compleat the courſe of our Series propoſed <hi>per ſaltum;</hi> omitting theſe gradations of <hi>Tumor</hi> and <hi>Inflammation.</hi>

            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:49201:18"/>
            <p>Many people upon the firſt ſeizure of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſome a while after, complain of a <hi>pain</hi> particularly in the <hi>Head, Breaſt, Bowels,</hi> &amp;c. here or there: this pain (eſpecially if great) takes off the appetite, prevents ſleep, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures a <hi>Feaver:</hi> for all <hi>acute</hi> diſeaſes are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>Feavers,</hi> and moſt of the <hi>chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic;</hi> at leaſt in their Paroxyſms of intenſion and exacerbations, have a <hi>febrile</hi> heat attending them. This is the common road of diſeaſes that are any thing ſevere; and ſuch as are acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but with the common road of Practice, have their eyes upon this external appearance, and general outward garb, by which, as their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, they ſteer and direct their courſe.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Feaver</hi> (a great Bug-bear, not known but by its name) a <hi>general</hi> Symptom of all ſharp diſtempers and dolorous diſeaſes; being obvious to the ſtanders by, and confirmed by ſentence of the Phyſician, takes up moſt of their thoughts in deſign how to maſter and ſecure this common enemy that ſtands foremoſt in view: and as their eyes are moſt or chiefly upon the <hi>Feaver,</hi> ſo their fears are from thence, and their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors are bent to ſuppreſs and abate this <hi>heat,</hi> and their aims levelled at this mark: and where this <hi>preternatural eſtuation</hi> is coming on, and feared only; or if already raiſed to a degree, all helps are then thought of, and uſed to damp and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh this kindling flame, as great and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning danger from thence, which byaſſeth the <hi>Phyſician</hi> from his right aims at the <hi>morbific</hi> cauſe.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:49201:18"/>
            <p>Hence ariſeth all the inventions of cooling, and ſo frequently uſed in moſt caſes: repeated <hi>Phlebotomies, Ptiſans, Juleps, Emulſions,</hi> cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Apozems, Embrocations, Liniments,</hi> &amp;c. which make the great clutter of Pots and Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes about the ſick, and nothing more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to the Apothecary than trifling away the time thus, with a number of theſe hazardous, but many times and too often, pernicious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
            <p>This mode of Practice, and theſe devices for cooling <hi>feaveriſh</hi> bodies, I ſuppoſe are taken up in imitation of <hi>Galen,</hi> a famous Maſter of this Art, who appoints exhauſtion of blood by Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy <hi>ad animi deliquium,</hi> until the Patient faints: and large draughts of cold water, until the Patient turns pale, ſhakes or quivers, and the whole body cooled.</p>
            <p>And an Author of our time, in his Writings <hi>de Febribus,</hi> appoints the caſements to be ſet open, to cool the ſick (upon what deſign I know not, except to fan the houſe, leſt the heat of the Feaver ſhould fire the chamber.)</p>
            <p>And a late <hi>Author</hi> of great Fame, in his Works <hi>de Febribus,</hi> ſuppoſing Feavers to ariſe <hi>à ſulphure accenſo &amp; exaltato,</hi> from a ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deflagration of the blood, proſecutes upon the indication of refrigerating and quenching this fire by cooling Liquors: and for incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment herein gives an example (I ſuppoſe his own Patient) of a young man about twenty years old, that by immoderate drinking of Wine,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49201:19"/>fell into a Feaver, with thirſt, and inſignal burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the Heart; who after Phlebotomy, and plentiful drinking of water (<hi>aquae fontanae ingentem quantitatem ebibit,</hi> the Authors words) he recovered. The ſucceſs was good, and I may ſay, <hi>wonderful;</hi> but whether from the means or Providence, judge you: but I ſhall not imitate the Practice, leſt <hi>ten</hi> dye for <hi>one</hi> that lives: but this learned Doctor hath highly deſerved in ſome other parts of his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and therefore I tread ſoftly.</p>
            <p>Now to conſider all this in groſs (for brevity ſake) and apply it to our purpoſe in hand: theſe ways truly are very probable (not rational) to cool a feaveriſh, hot, ſick man, and to make him in a ſhort time <hi>ſtone</hi>-cold: and the probability thereof upon good ground does appear thus.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Upon the account of this <hi>latent</hi> Series and progreſs, <hi>Inflammations, Tumors,</hi> &amp;c. uſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in by pain more frequently than diſcerned (as already proved) this <hi>refrigerating</hi> courſe, the inſiſting upon, or intermixing theſe cooling Medicines now and then, to quench a preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural heat is <hi>deſtructive;</hi> at beſt a great <hi>delay</hi> and impediment in the Cure: and this is the common way of Practice, which needs no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmation but a review.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In all other caſes, and from what cauſe ſoever a <hi>Feaver</hi> doth ariſe, this <hi>juleping</hi> and <hi>cooling</hi> mode of Practice, is dangerous more or leſs, as the caſe is in it ſelf; but in no wiſe advantageous; making <hi>acute</hi> diſeaſes to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49201:19"/>commute and terminate in <hi>chronic:</hi> and chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic or lingering diſeaſes to hold on their courſe, and become more contumacious.</p>
            <p>To prove the <hi>first,</hi> we ſhall compare that ſeries and commutation of diſeaſes, with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment and nature of theſe <hi>cooling</hi> Medicines; and by that you ſhall ſee what probability and ſeaſon there is to expect from thence any good effect; but rather the contrary, promoting of miſchief begun, and ſetting forward thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
            <p>Whatever cauſeth <hi>pain,</hi> whether it be <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> in the part, or <hi>oppreſſion</hi> by indigeſted or degenerate incongruous matter; by <hi>wind</hi> and <hi>flatulency,</hi> by any exotic generation, as <hi>worms , ſtones,</hi> &amp;c. any <hi>Tumor</hi> or <hi>Apostem</hi> breeding, <hi>Inflammation</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer</hi> planted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe cooling and cold inventions touch not the diſeaſe, (except to do miſchief and exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate) and remove no morbific cauſe: for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe cauſes and diſeaſes requires <hi>Aperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Absterſives, Catharticks, Diſcuſſives, Diaphoreticks, Diſſolvents, Sarcoticks,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pro re nata,</hi> each caſe requiring ſome or more Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments of theſe Operations.</p>
            <p>But theſe Coolers <hi>è contrà,</hi> ſtand in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and act repugnant to theſe properties, and conſequently to the Cures of thoſe infirmities: by <hi>obstructing</hi> of Ductures and Pores, <hi>incraſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> what ſhould be attenuated; <hi>coagulating</hi> what ſhould be kept fluid; <hi>condenſing</hi> what ought to be rarified and diſcuſſed; <hi>fixing</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:49201:20"/>and retaining what ſhould be moved and ſent off; <hi>impeding</hi> tranſpiration, but <hi>promoting</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction: generally, they check and damp the power of Nature, endeavouring to extricate and quit her ſelf from thoſe incumbrances and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evils that aſſault and beſet her.</p>
            <p>To make good the <hi>ſecond</hi> part, that in what other caſe ſoever, a <hi>Feaver</hi> or vehement heat ſhall ariſe with <hi>ebullition</hi> of the blood and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural fermentation; <hi>cooling</hi> Medicines are very prejudicial, in many caſes <hi>mortal;</hi> for whether it be a peſtilential or other maligne <hi>Miaſm,</hi> ſeminary or taint, or other impurity and feculency of the blood, that Nature intends by this febrile diſturbance and irritation to throw off and ſeparate, which Nature ſometimes without help does perform and makes a good <hi>Criſis:</hi> but theſe <hi>Coolers</hi> act counter to, and prevent Natures good work, checking the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, and thereby hindering the ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any degenerated or noxious admixture.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon of theſe ill conſequents from <hi>Coolers,</hi> does mainly lye here: for as the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach doth preſide over, and hath great influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the other faculties and ſubſequent digeſtions, whoſe briskneſs and vigorous perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance depend much thereon; ſo likewiſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſubverts the tone of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and flats the acuteneſs of this <hi>principal</hi> part, and prime office of digeſtion, injures, allays and abates the energy of the reſt, impedes the <hi>fermentation</hi> of the blood for depuration in ſuch caſes, as alſo
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49201:20"/>for conſervation and.ſupply in the conſtant daily work.</p>
            <p>And although the Patient eſcapes this <hi>Feaver</hi> and comes off with life; yet by this male Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice they fall into <hi>Dropſies, Scurvies, Jaundies</hi> and <hi>cachectic</hi> foul habits of body; an obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or tumified <hi>Spleen, Liver, Meſentery,</hi> &amp;c. Or it breaks out upon the <hi>Skin,</hi> and ſome eruption or cutany defedation will appear in time: or it ſettles in ſome <hi>Limb,</hi> and diſables the part.</p>
            <p>And it is but reaſonable to expect, that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients</hi> thus cured, ſhould ſoon be <hi>Patients</hi> again upon the old account, the relicts of the former ſickneſs; for that morbific matter and cauſe of <hi>Feaver,</hi> being retained, by checking and cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>febrile</hi> fermentation, and not obſerving <hi>Hippoc.</hi> advice, <hi>Quò natura vergit</hi>— this morbous impurity and foulneſs muſt <hi>precipitate</hi> and ſettle ſomewhere, and then you may well imagine it will make ſome appearance or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in time upon ſome part or other; and then an after-game is to be played; for not having its due <hi>fermentation, ſecretion</hi> and paſs-port for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, when it did <hi>turgere,</hi> and was upon the flight, only wanted the Phyſician's direction and guidance, hinted by <hi>Hippoc.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,— <hi>Aphor.</hi> 21. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. Now a hole in the skin perhaps is thought on; an <hi>Iſſue</hi> for a tedious and troubleſom vent, to diſcharge the matter, which a good laudable courſe in due time might have prevented.</p>
            <p>And thus, or by this means the Patient comes
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49201:21"/>into the Phyſicians hands again, and the ſame eſpecially that cured him of the <hi>dangerous Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi> and thus the ſuppoſed good Phyſician drives on, and is thought a very neceſſary Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor and an able Aſſiſtant upon all occaſions e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merging. Truly this is according to the homely Proverb, but <hi>Tinkerly</hi> doings, ſtop a <hi>Feaver</hi> (if it can be this way) and introduce what is more contumacious, difficult, and worſe to be dealt with.</p>
            <p>But ſome may object and ſay, That <hi>Lemons</hi> and <hi>Oranges</hi> are uſed in <hi>Feavers,</hi> and with good effects from their cooling: I anſwer, That <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Oranges, Barberries,</hi> and ſuch like, are allowable, and what good ariſeth from thence, is not to be aſcribed to their <hi>cooling</hi> virtue (if any) but to their <hi>acidity,</hi> which acuates and ſharpens the ferment of the ſtomach; by whoſe reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſtrength regained by this means, the whole body is refreſhed, fares the better, and ſome allay, at leaſt more ability to bear the <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile</hi> heat: and therefore likewiſe ſuch Liquors are to be granted the Patient for refreſhment and ſupport, as are moſt agreeable to the ſtomach and deſired; and the dictates of Nature in theſe caſes are to be marked, who prompts for her own help and ſatisfaction: and generally, the Drinks ſo deſired by them are <hi>fermented</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors (no Juleps) <hi>Beer, Ale, Cider, Wine,</hi> &amp;c. and ſuch are moſt agreeable to the ſtomach, which diſcreetly uſed, are no promoters nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuers of the Feaver, but beneficial in their
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49201:21"/>kind, and a relief to the ſick: but always to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> medical drinks upon a weak ſick man, as if he were to be nouriſhed and live by Phyſick, is very abſurd and irrational.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And here pertinent to our Diſcourſe, I muſt recite what I have formerly noted elſewhere: but by the way I muſt tell you, wherein I differ from other</hi> Phyſicians, <hi>when I grant my</hi> Patients <hi>cooling Drinks, as</hi> Whey, Cider, <hi>or ſuch like, when deſired in Feavers, or hot bodies: they lay a ſtreſs upon Coolers, as principal means againſt the Diſeaſe, and to reduce the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; I allow them not as</hi> Phyſick <hi>againſt the Diſeaſe, but as</hi> refreſhment <hi>to Nature, being delighted therewith and coveted: So that I do not impoſe them as of neceſſity, becauſe the Diſeaſe does not require it; but obſerving the propriety of the body, being comforted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed with ſuch of ſuch cooling Liquors. So that theſe are not given as Medicine (for they cure not, nor is</hi> heat <hi>to be regarded otherwiſe than as</hi> ſignal) <hi>but they may be allowed as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment. A labouring man that toils and heats himſelf, muſt have drinks to refreſh him: even ſo it is with a man in a</hi> Feaver; <hi>his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits labour more than at another time, and more thirſty he is, requiring drink more than at another time, and it muſt be ſuch as delights him, that Nature does deſired; not</hi> Barley <hi>water,</hi> Juleps, <hi>and ſuch ſlops, that the Patient nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeats, and give him no ſatisfaction.</hi> Tract. Of the Scurvy, Chap. 11. Edition 4.</p>

            <p>And in the ſame Chapter (controverting with Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> about <hi>Antiſcorbutic</hi> Remedies) there is much more to this purpoſe, ſhewing the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect proceeding againſt Feavers, with repeated Phlebotomy and cooling Medicines, whither I refer the Reader.</p>
            <p>And here I might animadvert and take notice of the ſtrange invention and irrational uſe of <hi>epiſpastic</hi> or bliſtering Plaſters to draw away a <hi>Feaver;</hi> ſhewing thereby alſo that Feavers are wholly miſtaken in the notion of them; but I muſt wave the Argument as collateral, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would interrupt our preſent occaſion, and divert me from the direct proſecution of the buſineſs in hand.</p>
            <p>Now in tlje cloſe, to obſerve the order and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of this Diſcourſe, and to take a review of the whole matter compendiouſly drawn up; you will find we have not deviated from the ſubject propoſed, but proſecuted. directly the ſcope of this deſignment, which in ſhort is thus.</p>
            <p>That this latent internal <hi>Series</hi> of Diſeaſes (more frequent than diſcerned) their dangerous <hi>tranſition</hi> and <hi>complication</hi> is masked and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with an apparent or outſide garb of a Feaver, or febrile preternatural heat; which <hi>ſignature</hi> and external <hi>character,</hi> hath ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed the Phyſicians endeavors, and taken up the Practice of this Art, that little hath been done in ſearching out the <hi>radix</hi> of diſeaſes, and opportunity neglected for proſecution againſt the <hi>morbific</hi> cauſes.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:49201:22"/>
            <p>And for as much as this <hi>Feaver</hi> being only the eſtuation of the vital Principle throughout the body, generally attending theſe and moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſeaſes, is no farther to be taken notice of, than as <hi>ſignal;</hi> ſhewing the cauſe to be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or leſs in provocation, as the heat is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe or remiſs; and does in no wiſe divert the Phyſicians intentions and deſign of Cure, nor ought to be applied unto, ſince it is only a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent</hi> and <hi>dependent</hi> occaſionally, from the morbific cauſe: which <hi>febrile</hi> heat riſeth and falleth, as the ſaid cauſe does more or leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke and irritate; and vaniſheth quite away when that cauſe is removed, or ceaſeth to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb: It neceſſarily then follows, that theſe <hi>Coolers</hi> generally uſed and mainly inſiſted on, are generally <hi>noxious,</hi> often <hi>mortal:</hi> giving great advantage to the train of diſeaſes (our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) towards a Cure whereof they contribute nothing; but <hi>è contrà,</hi> promote the progreſs.</p>
            <p>I might have amplified and inlarged thisDiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in ſeveral parts thereof; but this will ſuffice at preſent for a dawning and diſcovering light; which hereafter may appear with greater luſtre, as occaſion ſhall be offered by any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to theſe Truths.</p>
            <p>And thus: much in general touching this <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of Diſeaſes; their <hi>latency,</hi> their <hi>frequency,</hi> the danger by <hi>in advertency</hi> and improper mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken means, and too late diſcovery.</p>
            <p>Our next undertaking is, to view more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the <hi>gradations</hi> of this progreſs, tracing

               <p>OF all <hi>Symptoms</hi> that attend, or are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of Diſeaſes, <hi>Pain</hi> is the moſt troubleſom and irkſom to bear. <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and <hi>languiſhing</hi> are tolerable evils; but <hi>pain</hi> is reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, tormenting and full of complaints. And although this be the worſt (in extremity) to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide, and the moſt mournful accident that befals mans Body; yet no part thereof hath a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by Nature to be exempt, or protection from this calamity: the reaſon whereof we will inquire into.</p>
               <p>All parts of the Body wherein is the ſenſe of <hi>feeling,</hi> are liable to <hi>pain:</hi> and by virtue of this ſenſe, <hi>pain</hi> is communicated to this or that part: and therefore <hi>dead</hi> Bodies, parts <hi>paraly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, benummed</hi> or <hi>mortified</hi> are not capable of <hi>pain,</hi> becauſe in them there is not that ſenſe of <hi>feeling:</hi> and although the <hi>Organs</hi> of the other ſenſes are ſubject to pain, as the <hi>Eyes, Ears,</hi> &amp;c. yet <hi>pain</hi> is not proper to them <hi>(quatenus)</hi> as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49201:23"/>they belong to thoſe ſenſes; but as the ſenſe of <hi>feeling</hi> is ſeated there alſo, having a greater la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude than the other; and is extended through the Organs of all thoſe <hi>Senſes.</hi> True it is; the other <hi>ſenſes</hi> have their inconvenient and diſturbing objects, as the Philoſopher ſays, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellens ſenſibile laedit ſen ſum:</hi> as the light of the Sun, or flame is troubleſom to the <hi>Eyes;</hi> and great noiſe, as of a Bell or Gun, if near, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſudden and unexpected, does offend the <hi>Ears:</hi> and a ſtrong or ſtinking <hi>ſcent</hi> is offenſive to the <hi>Noſe:</hi> and an ungrateful <hi>taſte,</hi> as too <hi>ſalt,</hi> too <hi>ſowre,</hi> or <hi>bitter,</hi> is unpleaſant to the <hi>Palate:</hi> but <hi>pain</hi> affects the ſenſe of feeling.</p>
               <p>Parts therefore that are capable of <hi>pain</hi> are endowed with the ſenſe of <hi>feeling;</hi> and thoſe parts are <hi>membranous;</hi> that is, they are inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, or lined with ſome Membrane, by which the ſenſe of feeling is communicated; and hence the <hi>Bones</hi> are capable of <hi>pain,</hi> by the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſteum, that Membrane which covers them. And this ſenſe as it is more general, extending through all parts, and more uſeful than the reſt of the ſenſes; ſo the diſturbance ariſing thence is more inſufferable and grievous to be endured: and better it is to want any other <hi>ſenſe,</hi> than this, yea all; for where feeling is departed, the life is ceaſed in that part. This ſenſe therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſupreme,</hi> the defections and diſturbances thereof muſt be of greater importance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment than the reſt.</p>
               <p>The other <hi>Senſes</hi> are confined to, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49201:24"/>their functions in one <hi>Organ</hi> or part of the Body, the Eye, the Ear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but <hi>feeling</hi> is not reſtrained to ſo narrow a compaſs, but is ſeated in all parts of the Body, even in the <hi>Organs</hi> of thoſe other ſenſes. The great <hi>Prerogative</hi> of this <hi>ſenſe</hi> above the reſt, having no limits, but reaching through the whole Body , and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing its power among the other ſenſes, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable conſort with the life; were worth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the reaſons thereof, if time would give leave for that diverſion.</p>
               <p>What <hi>pain</hi> is, ſcarce any one but can tell; and ſome by woful <hi>Experience;</hi> whereby they will conſent with the definition thereof, <hi>dolor eſt triſtis ſenſatio in tactu:</hi> pain is a trouble ariſing in the ſenſe of feeling: but that which is ſo plainly felt, is not very eaſie to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood from whence it does ariſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of pain are as various as the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> of the ſenſe of <hi>Feeling:</hi> for whatever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects aſſault that ſenſe violently or extremely, as too <hi>hot, cold, hard, ſharp, heavy,</hi> &amp;c. are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to the Organ of Feeling, and do raiſe pain.</p>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>approximate</hi> cauſe of <hi>Pain,</hi> there are ſeveral opinions; I wave the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant and improbable, and ſhall recite thoſe in which the moſt <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and eminent <hi>Phyſicians</hi> do conſent and pitch upon as moſt agreeable to reaſon.</p>
               <p>One Party aſſerts, That a ſudden and violent mutation of the <hi>active</hi> qualities, or the <hi>tactil</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:49201:24"/>qualities ſuddenly and violently acting upon the ſenſe of feeling, are the approximate cauſe of pain.</p>
               <p>The other Party determines, That <hi>ſolutio continui,</hi> a ſolution or disjunction of continuity is the immediate cauſe of all <hi>pain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Opinion joyns theſe two together, and will have <hi>pain</hi> to ariſe from them both; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the definition of <hi>Plato: Eſt ita<expan>

               <p>Now to comment a little upon theſe different Judgments I cannot but obſerve and do owne that there is ſomething of probability and reaſon in theſe ſeveral ſentiments; but not a full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the matter queried; nor the whole truth rightly ſtated: and for this reaſon I am the more nice and ſtrict in this inquiry, becauſe from hence the nature of <hi>Anodynes</hi> or aſſwagers of <hi>pain</hi> are diſcovered; and this is the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work upon which they are formed and rightly adapted.</p>
               <p>I allow that <hi>unity</hi> is the perfection of Bodies, and is neceſſary to perfect <hi>ſanity;</hi> disjunction or ſeparation diſſolves the harmony, and leads or is the progreſs to deſtruction: for whatever tends to disjoyn or make a ſeparation of parts, does threaten to ruine the whole. And true it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49201:25"/>is, that the <hi>active</hi> qualities or <hi>tactil</hi> objects, do cauſe <hi>pain</hi> as they do make their impulſions vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently upon the Organ of <hi>Feeling;</hi> which when they do it moderately, placidly and amicably, they cauſe pleaſure or no pain. But whether the impetuous and vehement acts of thoſe Agents raiſing pain, do always cauſe a ſolution of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity approximately and immediately, is much to be doubted.</p>
               <p>I yield that the vehemency of theſe tactil ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may procure a ſolution of continuity ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as we ſee from <hi>pain,</hi> that <hi>Impoſthumes, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers, Gangrenes</hi> and <hi>Mortifications</hi> do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; but theſe are not inſeparable and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſequents, for they happen but ſometimes: pain may continue for a time, ceaſe again, and no breach of continuity remain a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> an effect thereof.</p>
               <p>To which our Adverſaries have this evaſion by way of Reply; That pain is cauſed <hi>à conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nui ſolutione, non à ſoluta unitate:</hi> which, as I conceive the meaning, is as much as to ſay; ſolution of continuity in <hi>fieri</hi> is ſufficient, though it be not in <hi>facto eſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to paſs over this Sophiſtry, as not worth the expence of time to lay it open; and if we make appear that the whole matter or contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie is bottomed upon this error, miſtaking the cauſe for the effect, and the effect for the cauſe. <hi>Cujus contrarium</hi>— then the pleadings of our Antagoniſts will be put to ſilence as abſurd, the doctrine laid aſide, and practice grounded upon better principles.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:49201:25"/>
               <p>They affirm <hi>ſolution</hi> of continuity to be the approximate cauſe of <hi>pain;</hi> the contrary where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we will ſet forth and prove, that <hi>pain</hi> is the cauſe of <hi>ſolution</hi> of continuity. And here we muſt firſt diſtinguiſh between violent external Agents, as <hi>ſword, ſtaff, bullet, fire,</hi> &amp;c. cauſing <hi>wounds, contuſions, fractures, combuſtions,</hi> &amp;c. and internal cauſes gradually ariſing in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as products of a degenerate ſtate.</p>
               <p>In the firſt caſes, <hi>ſolution</hi> of continuity cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>pain:</hi> as when the wound is given, pain follows as an effect: ſo likewiſe upon a ſudden <hi>fracture,</hi> or <hi>rupture</hi> in the latter, <hi>pain</hi> precedes as the approximate cauſe, <hi>ſolution</hi> of continuity comes after as the product or conſequent. For example; ſome indigeſted or degenerate matter lodgeth or fixeth in this or that part of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Nature not able to ſubdue or tranſmit it away, this like a <hi>thorn</hi> irritates and provokes the vital principle to a diſquietneſs and diſturbance, which is <hi>pain:</hi> this pain draws a confluence of humors to the part grieved, and increaſeth the firſt offending matter, cauſing <hi>Inflammation</hi> and <hi>Tumors;</hi> this apoſtemates, and then breaks forth into an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerve the <hi>Series,</hi> firſt here is peccant mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as the <hi>occaſional</hi> cauſe raiſing <hi>pain;</hi> this pain attracts humors from other parts, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tranſplanted out of their proper place, they degenerate, corrupt, and then produce an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthume</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer.</hi> Thus you ſee <hi>pain</hi> goes before, ſolution of <hi>continuity</hi> follows after, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49201:26"/>therefore it is plain, as in this, ſo in all other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes where ſeparation of unity does happen from an internal cauſe ariſing in the body; that it is the <hi>conſequent</hi> of pain, and not (as thoſe learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men would have it) the approximate <hi>cauſe</hi> of pain.</p>
               <p>To illuſtrate this truth a little farther, and that you may the better underſtand and have a clearer ſatisfaction herein (<hi>practice</hi> depending upon it, I mean the allay or remove of <hi>pains</hi>) conſider and know, that the ſenſe of <hi>Feeling</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpread through the whole body, is as the laſt or inmoſt covering, that does inwrap or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the <hi>life;</hi> and is as it were the watch or guard upon the confines thereof. Now any thing that does ſtir up <hi>Feeling,</hi> that thus nearly and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately approaches the <hi>life;</hi> if it exceed the bounds of moderation and is violent, if it be any way unnatural or injurious, it raiſeth a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance in the <hi>vital</hi> principle of that part, which is pain: ſo that the aſſault is firſt made upon the <hi>life,</hi> which governs and preſerves unity and continuity of parts; but that <hi>vital princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> being fretted , diſtracted and put by its pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid, regular oeconomy and government, the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> periſheth as the <hi>life</hi> of the part decays, or is out of courſe; being then unable to protect and preſerve it.</p>
               <p>From hence I am perſwaded to believe and muſt aſſert, That the <hi>approximate</hi> cauſe of <hi>pain</hi> is every thing that does intimately and approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately affect and diſguſt the <hi>vital</hi> principle in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49201:26"/>every part pained; which pain is the <hi>eſtuation, anguiſh</hi> and <hi>fury</hi> of the life or vital principle, which does <hi>dolere,</hi> being exaſperated and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by thoſe cauſes: and if ſolution of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity</hi> does happen upon this diſturbance, it is wrought and cauſed by the <hi>exorbitance</hi> and <hi>enormity</hi> of the vital principle, deſerting or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put by the charge and due management of the part.</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>pain</hi> ſometimes continues long by <hi>intervals</hi> and <hi>remiſſions</hi> to moleſt a part, and no ſeparation of unity to be cauſed thereby; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is an interruption and breach of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: ſo that this <hi>ira ſive dolor,</hi> this pain of the vital principle does not always ariſe to the height of producing diſcontinuity; and is ſo far from being the approximate <hi>cauſe</hi> of all <hi>pain,</hi> that many times it never happens either before or after pain, to be a <hi>cauſe</hi> or an <hi>effect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what this vital principle is, reſiding in and governing every part in their ſeveral fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of vitality, whether it be <hi>Anima;</hi> or <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus</hi> according to <hi>Helmonts</hi> doctrine; or <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus impetum faciens,</hi> according to <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;</hi> I ſhall not enter into the controverſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will require a large diſcourſe, or rather a peculiar <hi>Tract</hi> to determine this <hi>Problem,</hi> and clear up the truth of our novel opinion, diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling it from the objections and prejudice of ancient received doctrine; which will disjoyn and delay our matter chiefly intended, therefore I forbear the digreſſion, and proceed.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:49201:27"/>
               <p>Pains are <hi>various,</hi> or do affect the ſenſe in a different manner; and this either from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>part</hi> grieved, or from the variety of <hi>cauſes,</hi> or both.</p>
               <p>Now the nature and condition of parts are different and various theſe ten ſeveral ways, or may be reduced to theſe heads: <hi>Ducture, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, Situation, Compoſition, Beginning, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, Substance, Temperature, Number</hi> and <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> And as parts are varied by theſe differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo pains thereby are made various, and not only pains, but alſo all other Symptoms and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes have a <hi>ſpecification</hi> from hence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pain</hi> ſometimes is obtuſe or heavy, as if a weight were preſſing upon the part pained; as when the Parenchyma of the <hi>Liver, spleen, Lungs</hi> or <hi>Kidneys</hi> is grieved; and this by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they hang or depend on Ligaments and Membranes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pain</hi> ſometimes is <hi>acute,</hi> ſharp and punging; as if the part were perforated or pricked with a Needle; as in a <hi>Pleuriſie,</hi> and this is cauſed from a thin, acrid or acrimonious humor penetrating the <hi>Pleura;</hi> for nothing but what is ſubtile and acute can procure this or the like punctures, and invade the denſe ſubſtance of a <hi>Membrane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pain</hi> ſometimes is with <hi>pulſation,</hi> that is, a beating pain like to the motion of the Pulſe: and this pain happens commonly upon an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation,</hi> and alſo where an Artery is ſeated in the part; for where there is no Artery, there is no <hi>pulſation,</hi> it being the office of this Veſſel
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49201:27"/>only to make a pulſe. From hence <hi>Galen</hi> 2. <hi>de loc. affect.</hi> 3. took notice, that upon an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the <hi>Lungs</hi> or the <hi>Pleura,</hi> there was no pulſation or beating pain, becauſe there were no Arteries in the parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pain</hi> ſometimes is <hi>mordacious</hi> or biting, from ſharp humors vellicating the ſenſible parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pain</hi> ſometimes is <hi>frangitive,</hi> as if grinding or bruiſing, and this is proper only to the bones, or rather the <hi>Perioſteum</hi> that covers the bone, by which <hi>Membrane</hi> the bone is made ſenſible, and the pain lyes deep.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pain</hi> ſometimes is <hi>tenſive</hi> or ſtretching, and this happens from a repletion or fulneſs of ſome <hi>humor, wind</hi> or <hi>vapor,</hi> filling and extending the part: if this ſtretching pain be <hi>cum gravitate &amp; pondere,</hi> with heavineſs or weight, then you may conclude it is humoral, or ſomething of more ſolid ſubſtance; but if the extenſive pain be without weight, then it ſignifies <hi>wind</hi> or <hi>vapor:</hi> as very often ſuch are <hi>Colic</hi> pains, from a collection of wind between the tunicles of the guts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pain</hi> ſometimes is <hi>convulſive;</hi> and this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the <hi>Nerves</hi> and <hi>Tendons;</hi> becauſe the nervous filaments are ſo united, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be torn, but are contracted to their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pain</hi> ſometimes is <hi>lacerating</hi> or tearing: and this is proper to the <hi>fleſh;</hi> becauſe the fleſh hath Fibres and ſmall Nerves not ſo united as the Membranes, and therefore <hi>à cauſa ſolvente con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuum</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:49201:28"/>are eaſily lacerated. And thus much for the various kinds or different ſort of pain: next the <hi>ſituation</hi> or <hi>extenſion,</hi> and the <hi>duration</hi> is to be regarded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pain</hi> is either univerſal affecting the whole body, from ſome general cauſe; as in <hi>Feavers, Agues,</hi> &amp;c. Or elſe pain is ſeated in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular region or part of the body; as the <hi>Head, Breaſt, Stomach, Belly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pain</hi> ſometimes is more outward ot external upon the <hi>ſuperficies</hi> of the body, whoſe ſeat is more eaſily diſcovered and known, laying hand upon the place, by the Patients direction. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pain is <hi>internal</hi> and deep, with difficulty to be certainly determined, which part is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and requires good <hi>anatomical</hi> judgment to aſſign the part or member. From hence <hi>pains</hi> ſome may be ſaid to be <hi>manifeſt,</hi> others <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe;</hi> as alſo from their cauſes, evident and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pains</hi> ſome are <hi>conſtant</hi> as to <hi>place,</hi> or fixed; others <hi>erratic</hi> or ſhifting from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pains</hi> ſome are conſtant as to <hi>time,</hi> or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual; others intermitting and by intervals, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ceſſation for a time and returning again.</p>
               <p>In all pains there ought to be conſidered theſe four things: the <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> the <hi>Kind,</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,</hi> the <hi>Place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Greatneſs</hi> and vehemency of <hi>pain</hi> does ariſe from the greatneſs of the offending cauſe, and the ſenſibility called tenderneſs of the part. All
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49201:28"/>
                  <hi>pain</hi> ſpends or wears and abates the ſtrength of Nature; but violent and vehement <hi>pain</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſudden relief, leſt the ſick faint or expire. Upon the firſt aſſault Nature does inſurge and raiſeth all her ſtrength to bear, reſiſt and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the offending cauſe, and cooperates vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly with the means for relief and eaſe; but help not coming, ſtrength abates, grows weaker and weaker, as not able to hold it out long: and this is perceived and known by the Pulſe, which at the firſt acceſs of great <hi>pain,</hi> beats high, ſtrong and quick; but afterwards falls off, grows weak, ſmall, ſlow, or ſwift, labouring and languiſhing,</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Kind</hi> and nature of the <hi>pain</hi> is to be obſerved and noted; whether <hi>tenſive, heavy, acute, biting,</hi> &amp;c. that accordingly fit Remedies may be adapted to ſuch variations.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Property</hi> is to be regarded; whether pain be moveable or fixed: continual or conſtant; or returning by intervals; whereby the fallacy or certainty of the Cauſe may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Place</hi> of <hi>pain</hi> is to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed: for that which will be a good reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and proper to one part or member, may prove of little advantage or injurious to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; becauſe ſome parts have <hi>Antipathy</hi> or diſguſt and diſlike to ſome remedies, which <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione morbi,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> may be proper and requiſite, but the <hi>part</hi> will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it: as <hi>Oyl</hi> generally is <hi>anodyne</hi> and aſſwag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49201:29"/>but hot in pains of the <hi>Eyes,</hi> for there it is injurious to the part: and a puncture of the <hi>fleſh</hi> and a puncture of a <hi>Nerve,</hi> will require different remedies. And upon this account <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> 4. <hi>Meth.</hi> 5. would not allow of <hi>Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> to every wound, and chiefly in the <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> and <hi>Nerves,</hi> and condemns thoſe Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions that make not that diſtinction.</p>
               <p>And here you muſt diligently ſearch and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, whether the pain be <hi>idiopathical</hi> or <hi>ſympathical:</hi> that is, whether the part pained does ſuffer <hi>per ſe,</hi> from a cauſe reſiding in that part; or whether the cauſe lyes in another part, and the part pained does complain <hi>per ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiam ſeu conſenſum,</hi> only by conſent from ſome other diſeaſed or diſtempered part.</p>
               <p>And this diſtinction ought ſtrictly to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, without which no Cure can ſucceed: for if the <hi>peccant</hi> matter or cauſe offending lye in one <hi>part,</hi> and the remedy be applied to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you cannot in reaſon hope for a good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thereon. This therefore is to be received as a fundamental Truth, That all parts of the Body may fail in their office and true perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their duties, <hi>vel vitio proprio, vel alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> either by a deficiency of their own, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation and injury from other parts: and this not being duly taken notice of by ſome <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,</hi> no wonder if <hi>Patients</hi> languiſh ſo long under their hands, waiting in vain for their relief and Cure: for, finding the Patient to complain of <hi>pain</hi> in this or that part, they think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49201:29"/>but applying to the <hi>part pained;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding with the common ſaying: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi eſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, ibi eſt morbus,</hi> which is oftentimes a great miſtake. For example: the <hi>Head</hi> akes and complains many times, not from any defect of its own, being firm and ſound; but either from the <hi>Stomach</hi> being foul or otherwiſe diſeaſed, whoſe ill affects alſo are communicated to the <hi>Head</hi> by the <hi>Nerves</hi> of the ſixth conjugation: ſometimes from the <hi>Spleen;</hi> ſometimes from the <hi>Womb;</hi> and ſometimes from other parts, by reaſon of the <hi>Nerves</hi> propagated into all parts of the Body, having their original from the <hi>Brain</hi> and <hi>ſpinal Marrow,</hi> derived from thence and of the ſame nature; from whence the <hi>Head</hi> does conſent with all thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Arm</hi> may complain, wanting its power of due motion or ſtrength, although the Arm be ſound and well; yet if the <hi>Nerves</hi> that ſupply thoſe Muſcles of the Arm with Spirits be hurt, the <hi>Muſcles</hi> are deprived of their uſe or act deficiently and depravedly. As by a blow upon the <hi>Back</hi> (or by other cauſes there not ſo manifeſt) the <hi>Arm</hi> may fail in its due motion, the <hi>Nerves</hi> being injured: in vain then it is to apply Topical Medicines to the <hi>Arm,</hi> but appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation muſt be made to the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back, from whence the Nerves are derived and implanted into thoſe Muſcles.</p>
               <p>And ſince the ſeveral parts of the Body do complain, ſometimes by their own fault or decay in themſelves; and ſometimes only by injury
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49201:30"/>transferred or received from other parts; we will conſide how many ways there are for parts of the Body to be ill-affeced and receive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice one from the other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sympathy</hi> or conſent of parts, whereby one ſuffers from another, may ariſe upon a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble account.</p>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Per Sympathiam generis,</hi> by which we underſtand that conſent and affect that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by continuity of parts of the ſame kind: as when the <hi>Neck</hi> being hurt, the <hi>Hand</hi> conſents and complains; becauſe the Nerve ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and coming down to the Hand, is derived from the <hi>Neck:</hi> and this way of conſent may alſo be effected, not only by the long <hi>Nerves,</hi> but alſo by the long <hi>Muſcles,</hi> and the Veins in other parts: as ſometimes it happens that the Leg is ſtiff and wants its flexibility and bending inwards by reaſon of ſome diſeaſe, not in the <hi>Leg,</hi> but in the <hi>Hip,</hi> where the original of the <hi>Muſcle</hi> is, that ſerves for this motion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore erroneouſly ſome have applied <hi>Fomentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguents</hi> and <hi>Plaſters</hi> to the Leg upon this ſuppoſition, <hi>Quò ubi eſt ſymptoma, ibi ſit morbus;</hi> not conſidering that the Tibia does ſuffer by conſent, and the root of the diſeaſe lyes <hi>in Coxendice</hi> where the Muſcle does ariſe. And thus it falls out very often, that the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:49201:30"/>is far diſtant from the <hi>Symptoms;</hi> and therefore the original and progreſs of the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles ought diligently to be obſerved in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as theſe, that the part <hi>primarily</hi> affected, and the part affected by <hi>conſent</hi> may be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, elſe the deſignment of Cure will fail and be inſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſent of Parts is procured <hi>ob Familiaritatem ſeu per conſortium operis:</hi> and this conſent is common to all thoſe parts that are ordained by Nature to concur together in ſome common office: and thus it is between the <hi>Womb</hi> and the <hi>Dugs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſent of Parts is frequent <hi>propter Vicinitatem,</hi> by reaſon of vicinity &amp; adjacency: when parts are ſituate near to each other they are mutually affected, either by ſome ſenſible paſſages or inſenſible, for <hi>totum corpus eſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirabile,</hi> the whole body is perſpirable by Pores latent arid inviſible, by which there is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to and reception from each other, and do thereby <hi>ſympathize</hi> with the good or ill of one another, although the ways of communication are not manifeſt: and thus it is between the <hi>Stomach</hi> and the <hi>Lungs,</hi> and is eaſily perceived by fuch as are <hi>Aſthmatical, Phthiſical</hi> or have Coughs, that by eating or drinking this or that, thoſe infirmities will be exaſperated and made worſe, almoſt preſently: and <hi>è contrà,</hi> they will receive ſome eaſe and benefit by that which is good, ſoon after it is received into the <hi>Stomach;</hi> long before it can make a progreſs the common

And this conſent like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is between the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> the mouth of the <hi>Stomach</hi> and the <hi>Heart:</hi> and thus it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween the <hi>Bladder</hi> and the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum</hi> the laſt Gut; and from hence pains of the <hi>Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> are mitigated and eaſed by <hi>Clyſters,</hi> through inſenſible paſſages, and not by any manifeſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture or Veſſel of communication.</p>
               <p>From hence we may learn by ſuch Examples, that <hi>Sympathy</hi> and conſent of parts is ſtrictly to be marked, elſe it is not poſſible to know where the root of a Diſeaſe is, and from whence pain or other Symptoms do ariſe: for, one part may be pained, and the diſeaſe lye in another; and if this be not rightly diſtinguiſhed, there cannot be a true <hi>adaptation</hi> of Medicines, nor due <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> made where it ought to be, which renders all endeavors fruſtraneous.</p>
               <p>But to deſcend from <hi>generals,</hi> and to make our Diſcourſe more profitable and ſatisfactory to the <hi>particular</hi> caſes of the Reader, inquiring after his own peculiar concern and preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; we will take notice of ſome pains inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> parts of the Body remarkable and frequently occurring, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining their cauſes.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THat the <hi>Head</hi> akes, every one can tell that ſuffers under it; but the <hi>cauſes</hi> and the <hi>parts</hi> affected diſtinctly, are known only to the <hi>Phyſician:</hi> and he by queſtioning and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the <hi>Patient,</hi> draws his concluſions by collating the ſeveral anſwers, and makes Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereupon. All which depends upon a due obſervance of theſe four Particulars, rightly to determine the caſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Inquiry</hi> is to be made of the Patient concerning his courſe of <hi>life</hi> for ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whether regular or irregular; in labour, exerciſe, or eaſe; if thereby any thing hath been done to procure or introduce the preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and of his former ſtate of <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Sickneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Of his ſtate and condition of <hi>Body</hi> as it <hi>now</hi> is.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>place</hi> or ſeat of <hi>pain,</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs and extent of it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The <hi>quality</hi> or condition of the <hi>pain;</hi> vehement or moderate, continual or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting, acute or obtuſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having made diſquiſition by theſe <hi>Topicks,</hi> and traced the <hi>Patient</hi> through theſe grand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries; you will then underſtand ſomething of the <hi>riſe</hi> and <hi>progreſs</hi> of the pain ſought after, giving you then occaſion to take a farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49201:33"/>and conſideration of the various differences of <hi>pains</hi> in the <hi>Head,</hi> wherein your preſent caſe will be found, and exhibited to your view, as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Head-aches</hi> are either more <hi>general</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, affecting the <hi>whole;</hi> or elſe <hi>one</hi> ſide of the Head; or ſome particular part, as <hi>Forehead, Temples,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Head-pains are either <hi>internal</hi> or <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Idiopathical</hi> or <hi>Sympathical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Recent</hi> and of late ſtanding, or <hi>inveterate</hi> and of long continuance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pain</hi> of the whole Head or major part does denote the cauſe to be more general and of large extent; as in <hi>Feavers</hi> and <hi>plethoric</hi> perſons, wherein the whole body is diſtempered, and from thence the whole Head or moſt part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with affected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pain</hi> in particular places; as of the right or left ſide, fore-part or hind-part, the top or the crown, ſignifies the cauſe to be, or act there on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and does ariſe from ſome defect or trouble in the part it ſelf, by ſome peccant humor there bred, or by <hi>tranſmiſſion</hi> of morbific matter from, or by conſent with ſome other part diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, adjacent or remote. As more particularly hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now you muſt underſtand, that although every perſon ſeems to be equally diſpoſed alike, and liable to theſe <hi>pains;</hi> yet it is much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for ſome are often complaining of <hi>Head-ach,</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:49201:33"/>ſome rarely or never: and this by reaſon of the different <hi>fabrication</hi> and formation of parts, as well within as without the man; and alſo by reaſon of the <hi>ſoundneſs</hi> and ſtrength of parts that ſome have above another; by which they endure long, and free from pain or other infirmities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Internal</hi> pain is ſeated within the <hi>Cranium</hi> or Skull, and ſignifies the <hi>Brain</hi> it ſelf, or <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes</hi> inveſting the Brain; or ſome Veſſel, <hi>Vein, Artery</hi> or <hi>Nerve</hi> to be affected: if the <hi>Brain</hi> akes, the pain is obtuſe and heavy, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is much inclining to ſleep or drowſineſs: ſo likewiſe when the Veins are moleſted, the pain is remiſs: but if the <hi>Membranes</hi> or <hi>Nerves</hi> be the complaining parts, the pain is more acute and punging; and then it reacheth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to the roots of the <hi>Eyes;</hi> becauſe theſe Membranes do cover the <hi>Optick Nerves</hi> which lead to the Eyes: and it may be known what <hi>Nerve</hi> is affected, by the part conſenting, which that Nerve does ſupply and ſerve; and thus ſometimes the <hi>Ear,</hi> or <hi>Tongue;</hi> ſometimes the <hi>Shoulders,</hi> or <hi>Breaſt</hi> complains, by that <hi>Nerve</hi> inſerted into them for their uſe: but if an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> be the place, then the <hi>pain</hi> is beating, Pulſe-like.</p>
               <p>External <hi>pain</hi> is ſuperficial and without the <hi>Skull,</hi> ſhewing that the <hi>Pericranium</hi> or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane covering the Skull is the part grieved: and ſometimes the <hi>Cutis</hi> or outward skin only, and then the pain is more remiſs; but both are
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49201:34"/>known and aggravated by compreſſing the part or place: and if the pain be in the <hi>fore</hi>-part of the Head, and extend to the Eye-brow, the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſteum</hi> is affected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pains</hi> of the Head <hi>per eſſentiam</hi> or Idiopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thical, are when the cauſe of pain is ſeated in the part pained, by reaſon of <hi>debility</hi> or <hi>dyſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie</hi> and infirm ſtate thereof: from whence ill matter is congeſted and accumulated, cauſing a diſturbance or diſtemper; and ſometimes pains fixed from extraordinary productions there ingendred and bred; as worms, ſtones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as hath been noted by Authors of repute and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: <hi>Hollerius, Schenkius, Kentman,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pains</hi> of the Head <hi>ſympathical</hi> are when the cauſe lyes remote, and the part pained ſuffers by <hi>Sympathy,</hi> tranſmiſſion or conſent from other members, and not by any proper defect or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability of its own. And thus the <hi>Head</hi> is very apt <hi>compati</hi> to ſuffer and condole with moſt parts of the Body; by reaſon the <hi>Nerves</hi> are branched forth and diſperſed in all parts of the Body from the <hi>Brain</hi> and <hi>ſpinal</hi> Marrow; which being of exquiſite ſenſe does affect their original and fountain by this communication and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with other parts: and not only by the <hi>Nerves</hi> coming from the <hi>Head</hi> is this conſent maintained, but alſo by the <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> going from other parts up to the Head, convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good or ill. Hence it is, that very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Head is pained from diſtempers of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49201:34"/>
                  <hi>Stomach;</hi> ſometimes from the <hi>Spleen, Womb, Inteſtines,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Having given you the various differences of <hi>Head</hi>-pains as to the quality or condition of them, and alſo pointed at the ſeveral parts affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>per ſe &amp; per conſenſum:</hi> I come now to ſet forth the cauſes or riſe of theſe pains from whence they ſpring; whether generated in the <hi>Head,</hi> or communicated to it from other <hi>parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Cauſes of. <hi>Head-achs</hi> or pains are, <hi>external</hi> and <hi>internal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>External <hi>Cauſes</hi> may be ſuch as theſe; as when the Head is expoſed to <hi>heat</hi> or <hi>cold,</hi> a ſtrong <hi>ſcent</hi> ſweet or ſtinking, <hi>Fumes</hi> or <hi>ſmoke,</hi> a <hi>blow</hi> or <hi>fall,</hi> &amp;c. occaſioning diſturbance of the Spirits, <hi>Obſtructions</hi> in the Pores and Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, <hi>Inflammations, Tumors</hi> or <hi>Impoſthumes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Internal <hi>Cauſes</hi> are, ſometimes <hi>plenitude</hi> or fulneſs of blood, which then upon ſmall occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is ready to eſtuate and ferment, cauſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of the Veſſels and Membranes: or elſe depravation and foulneſs of the blood which may offend the <hi>Brain,</hi> or other parts of the Head by its noxious properties.</p>
               <p>Now the degeneration of the <hi>blood</hi> from its due and laudable ſtate, to an evil and bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is various, and does manifeſt it ſelf by divers Symptoms in ſeveral parts of the Body; and alſo when it is let out of the body, by <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſapor, conſiſtence, heat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Either the blood is impoveriſhed and defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in vital <hi>Spirits</hi> and heat, ſlow in <hi>motion,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49201:35"/>feculent, groſs</hi> or <hi>grumous,</hi> and thereby apt to be <hi>ſtagnant</hi> or obſtruct: or elſe too hot and fiery, cauſing inquietude of the Spirits and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular motions of that vital ſtream, diſturbing the Head with pain and watchfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>blood</hi> degenerates ſometimes from its Balſamic qualities, into an acrid, ſharp or acrimonious condition; and then moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly there is an abounding <hi>ſeroſity,</hi> or a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous <hi>latex</hi> or water; which ſtate of the blood, as very remarkable, cauſing many diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, I ſhall ſet forth in another Work <hi>(Deo vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lente)</hi> to be made publick.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>blood</hi> may be contaminated with a contagious, malignant or virulent <hi>Miaſm</hi> and taint; as in the <hi>Plague,</hi> ſmall <hi>Pox,</hi> highly graduate <hi>Scorbute, Venereal Lues,</hi> (as more fully appears in my Tracts of the <hi>Scurvy</hi> and that of the Venereal <hi>Lues.</hi>) In all which caſes the Head frequently is offended and ſuffers pain.</p>
               <p>And here: alſo we muſt account amongſt the internal cauſes,</p>
               <p>Impotency and weakneſs of ſome <hi>Organical</hi> parts of the <hi>Head,</hi> not performing their office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſtructions</hi> of ſome ducture or poroſity, by <hi>conſtriction, compreſſion</hi> or <hi>coagulation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Congeſted</hi> matter infeſting any part of the Head raiſeth pain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wind</hi> or flatulent Spirits roving here and there may produce the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Watching</hi> unſeaſonably, which tires the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, cauſeth diſturbance in the Head.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:49201:35"/>
               <p>Immoderate <hi>ſtudy</hi> or cogitation weakens the Brain, and renders it liable to pain.</p>
               <p>Violent <hi>motion</hi> agitating the Spirits furiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and driving the humoral currents out of their natural placid courſe, diſcompoſeth the <hi>Head</hi> and may cauſe <hi>pain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Immoderate <hi>Venus,</hi> or long forbearance: the firſt by too great exhauſtion and draining the <hi>Nerves;</hi> the latter by <hi>plenitude,</hi> over-charging the <hi>Genital</hi> Veſſels, reverberating back, or by conſent affects the Head.</p>
               <p>And now briefly I ſhall ſhew here, what <hi>parts</hi> chiefly and frequently the <hi>Head</hi> conſents with, from whence internal cauſes of <hi>pain</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated; and as theſe <hi>parts</hi> are well or ill by intervals, ſo the <hi>Head</hi> is better or worſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Stomach</hi> in the firſt place, as being the general and grand office of preparation to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the whole body with nutriment; ſo is it the part that moſt frequently afflicts the <hi>Head</hi> by communication, through Veſſels of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe conveying to each other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Head</hi> complains from the <hi>Stomach</hi> either <hi>before</hi> meat, when ſuppoſed to be empty; or <hi>after</hi> meat, when replete and filled.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Head</hi> complains before eating, it argues the <hi>Stomach</hi> to have ſome remainders or relicts from former digeſtions not wrought off, that does diſturb the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and from thence the <hi>Head:</hi> if <hi>after</hi> meat the <hi>Head</hi> akes, it does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the <hi>Stomachs</hi> indiſpoſition to digeſt, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49201:36"/>imbecillity to overcome what is received, and labouring under the burden, the <hi>Head</hi> ſuffers alſo.</p>
               <p>Now to know that the <hi>Stomach</hi> is not in good order or ability for the true performance of its office in digeſtion, is manifeſt by theſe ſigns: <hi>Vomiting</hi> or <hi>nauſeating, pain, oppreſſion</hi> or <hi>heavineſs, eructation</hi> or <hi>belching,</hi> want of <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,</hi> or <hi>thirſtineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here by way of caution in this conſent between the Stomach and the Head, you muſt rightly diſtinguiſh, leſt it happen, as ſometimes it doth, that the <hi>Stomach</hi> ſuffers from the <hi>Head,</hi> and not the <hi>Head</hi> from the <hi>Stomach:</hi> and ſince the conſent is reciprocal and mutual, you muſt nicely obſerve which is the part primarily affected, and which the part by conſent; elſe endeavors of relief will be fruſtrate, if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin not with the part <hi>primariò</hi> diſeaſed, to free and ſet that right, for then the other ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and of courſe will be reduced.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spleen</hi> being ill-affected, draws the <hi>Head</hi> into conſent ſometimes, and participates of its evil: and this is to be known by examining the <hi>Spleen,</hi> whether any Symptom of diſorder or diſtemper is manifeſt there or from thence. Now the ſigns of a diſeaſed Spleen are theſe; <hi>pain, hardneſs, tumor</hi> or <hi>extenſion, flatulent</hi> motions in the left <hi>Hypochonder</hi> or ſide under the ſhort Ribs: And moſt commonly the Head is affected or pained on the ſame ſide, or elſe the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:49201:36"/>
               <p>If the <hi>Liver</hi> occaſions the diſturbance or pain in the <hi>Head;</hi> for the moſt part the <hi>pain</hi> is ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the right ſide, and then ſome Symptoms of a diſtempered <hi>Liver</hi> will appear; as <hi>heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> or <hi>fulneſs</hi> in the right ſide, <hi>hardneſs, pain</hi> or <hi>heat,</hi> affecting alſo the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and cauſing thirſt; alſo drineſs or heat in the palms of the <hi>hands</hi> and ſoles of the <hi>feet:</hi> and as theſe ſigns have their intention or remiſſion, ſo the Head is better or worſe.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Womb</hi> be in fault, and cauſe pain of the <hi>Head</hi> (as frequently it doth by the great communication and conſent between theſe parts) then either there is a ſuppreſſion of the <hi>menſtrual</hi> purgation; or irregular and out of due courſe, not keeping the due times; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient in quantity, or abounding: or too long retenſion of <hi>ſemen;</hi> or too great a profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and waſting. Some of theſe cauſes are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, not only to diſturb the <hi>Head,</hi> but alſo divers other parts of the body; and theſe pains of the <hi>Head</hi> ariſing by conſent from the <hi>Womb,</hi> do moſt commonly affect the <hi>top</hi> or <hi>hind</hi>-part of the Head.</p>
               <p>If from the <hi>Inteſtines</hi> pains of the Head do proceed, then either <hi>worms</hi> are bred there; or the Guts are troubled with <hi>ſharp</hi> or corrupt humors; or elſe there is <hi>coſtiveneſs</hi> and ſiccity of the Bowels, whereby the Excrements are baked and hardned, cauſing too long retention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from hence by Veſſels of communication the Head complains alſo.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:49201:37"/>
               <p>If from the <hi>Kidneys</hi> the Head is grieved; then inquire into the condition of the Kidneys, and you will find ſome ſignals of a Diſeaſe there: either <hi>ſtone</hi> or <hi>gravel,</hi> or a ſharp <hi>Serum,</hi> an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation</hi> or preternatural <hi>heat,</hi> an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer</hi> or <hi>Excoriation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as concerning the Cure of <hi>Head-achs,</hi> and likewiſe of all pains that ariſe by conſent from other parts, take this general Rule; That in the firſt place application be made to the part <hi>primarily</hi> affected, to reduce that into a ſtate of integrity; then conſider the part that ſuffered by <hi>communication</hi> and participation, if by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance or length of time, any impreſſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main there, or debility, that may require help, although the <hi>foundation</hi> or firſt cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint be removed; elſe you begin at the wrong end: for in vain it is to endeavor amendment in the part <hi>conſenting,</hi> until the other be in its rectitude, <hi>ſublatâ cauſâ tollitur effectus.</hi> For example; if the <hi>Head</hi> complain from the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> let the Cure be deſigned upon the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> and that being performed, the work is done.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee plainly, that the Cure of <hi>Head</hi>-pains by conſent, is as various and different, as the parts of the Body are different in organiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſituation and office; whereby they become liable, and are ſeized with various diſeaſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a different manner or methods of curing, which are to be treated of in their proper places.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:49201:37"/>
               <p>Touching the Cure of <hi>Head</hi>-pains that are the products or conſequents of <hi>eſſential</hi> or <hi>idio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathical</hi> Diſeaſes ſeated in the Head; the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or taking away thoſe pains depends upon the Cure of thoſe Diſeaſes, whereof they are the effects and concomitants; and do require their due and regular courſe of means, ſuitable to the nature of the diſeaſe: but in caſes of extremity, and for mitigation of pain, and the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ariſing thence, as long watching or want of reſt, and proſtration of ſtrength; there are ſuch good Remedies, as <hi>Anodynes,</hi> prudently to be uſed for allay and giving eaſe or reſpite, until the cauſes can be eradicated, and a perfect Cure wrought.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Pains in the <hi>Thorax</hi> or Breaſt.</head>
               <p>AMongſt the ſeveral diviſions of mans <hi>Body</hi> into parts, we may obſerve three inſignal <hi>Cavities,</hi> each containing principal Members of the Body: the firſt and ſupreme is the <hi>Head,</hi> and all contained therein: the middle cavity is the <hi>Breaſt,</hi> which contains the <hi>Lungs</hi> and <hi>Heart:</hi> the lower region called the <hi>Abdomen</hi> or <hi>Belly,</hi> comprehends the <hi>Stomach, Liver, Spleen, Guts, Kidneys,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And having taken cognizance of thoſe pains incident to the <hi>Head;</hi> we now come to remark what pains happen to the containing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49201:38"/>parts of the <hi>Breast.</hi> Hence we may note, that theſe pains from their ſituation and place, may be diſtinguiſhed into external and internal.</p>
               <p>External <hi>pains</hi> we may call ſuch as are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward amongſt the muſculous and fleſhy parts, as the <hi>Paps, Dugs</hi> and intercoſtal <hi>Muſcles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Internal pains are ſuch as ſeize the <hi>Heart, Lungs, Mediaſtinum,</hi> &amp;c. parts contained.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Breast</hi> is circumſcribed thus; the upper part is from the two <hi>Canal</hi>-bones called <hi>Clavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae,</hi> about the bottom of the Neck; the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part is bounded by the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driff ſpread juſt above the <hi>Stomach</hi> and <hi>Liver</hi> from ſide to ſide: the fore-part is the <hi>Sternon</hi> or Breaſt-bone ſeated in the middle, which joins and faſtens the Ribs: on the back-part is the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> or Spine, conſiſting of many bones knit together, where alſo the Ribs have their articulation: the ſides are compaſſed with Ribs ſwelling outwards, and they reach from the <hi>Spine</hi> to the Sternon. And this is the extent or limits of the Breaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pain</hi> may fall into the <hi>Paps</hi> or <hi>Dugs</hi> of both Sexes, but moſt commonly it happens ſo to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (except from external cauſes, blows or falls) and thus it is upon a ſixfold account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Becauſe thoſe parts are more capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſwelling outwards in Women, which being <hi>glandulous,</hi> ſpongy, ſoft and porous, are thereby apt to imbibe or receive any vagrant humor coming to this part.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:49201:38"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> More liable to the impreſſions of cold, from its tender ſoft nature, and being by them more frequently expoſed to the air; which may occaſion and lay a foundation for pain and other Symptoms to follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In Women theſe parts being furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with more Veſſels of uſe for lactation or ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, are thereby more liable and obnoxious to diſorder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> From the communication and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe between this part and the <hi>Womb,</hi> whoſe diſeaſes and diſtempers may affect the other by conſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> From the attraction of ſuckling, ill humors may be drawn and gathered there, which otherwiſe would not reſort to that part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Pain ſeizeth this part in Women from the various conditions of their milk.</p>
               <p>Now the variations of milk cauſing this effect ariſe upon a double account: <hi>redundance</hi> or plenitude, and <hi>Cacochymy</hi> or alienation. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by plenitude; for milk abounding and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtending the Veſſels cauſeth pain and trouble in the part. Sometimes by <hi>alienation</hi> of milk from its natural good condition to a degenerate ſtate: and this proceedeth from a <hi>cachectic</hi> or vicious habit of body; for as the blood is good or bad, ſo likewiſe the milk, which is <hi>ſanguis dealbatus,</hi> blood changed white by another digeſtion.</p>
               <p>This milky ſubſtance being <hi>balſamic,</hi> dulcid and pure in its integrity; yet is very ſubject to alterations and change from diſtempers and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49201:39"/>diſpoſitions of the Body: as ſometimes from thence, being not ſo ſweet; but <hi>ſaltiſh, bitter, acrid</hi> and <hi>punging;</hi> ſometimes curdling and coagulating, thereby not flowing freely in the Veſſels, but cauſing obſtructions in thoſe ſmall ductures: hence ariſe <hi>pains, inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hardneſs, tumors,</hi> &amp;c. if not prevented by a due courſe with good means.</p>
               <p>And ſuch inconveniencies as theſe are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to Women after the birth of children, when <hi>milk</hi> flows plentifully into thoſe parts; and this many times or for the moſt part does proceed from the imprudent cuſtom of mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Women in child-bed, eſpecially ſome <hi>Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> who would be thought more careful, kind and diligent to their Miſtreſſes; do feed them too plentifully, giving them Caudle at every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> or after every ſhort ſleep night and day; telling them they are empty and muſt fill up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and make up their loſs: which after this manner being done too haſtily, and the body changing from a large evacuation to a ſudden <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But indeed by experience I have found, and reaſon urgeth the ſame, that nothing is more ſafe than a ſpare diet, which preſerves the <hi>Stomach</hi> quick and ſharp, and keeps the whole body in a moderate temper and a regular condition, not
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49201:39"/>occaſioning ſuch overflowings of milk, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>flouding:</hi> and this I have cautioned and made ſome <hi>Nurſes</hi> ſenſible of, who by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance thereof afterwards, found their offices more ſucceſsful and have given me thanks for my advice, as being the ſafeſt and beſt way to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the truſt and care repoſed in them.</p>
               <p>In the next place we are to take notice of pains that are ſeated in the <hi>muſculous</hi> parts, namely the <hi>intercoſtal</hi> Muſcles, in number 44; ſo called from <hi>Coſtae</hi> the Ribs, which theſe Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c;les do cover, and alſo are inſerted, filling up the ſpaces between each Rib. In theſe parts pains ſometimes do fix and ſettle, and are moſt perceived upon drawing in of the breath, when the Muſcles are upon extenſion and ſwelling outward. Theſe pains are called by ſome Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard <hi>Pleuriſies,</hi> though improperly and by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake; for pains of the Pleura are different. Sometimes theſe pains are not of continuance as to time; nor conſtant as to place, but move here and there; and theſe are commonly called Stitches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pains</hi> are incident to theſe <hi>Muſcles</hi> from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal injuries, as <hi>contuſions,</hi> and impreſſions of <hi>cold:</hi> or elſe internal cauſes; and theſe are, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>defluxion</hi> of humors that may flow in; as moſt frequently from an abounding <hi>ſeroſity</hi> being thin, ſharp and extravaſated, falls in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe Muſcles: or elſe, by <hi>congeſtion</hi> matter is accumulated, which Nature not being able to diſcharge, lyes there as a burden, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49201:40"/>the muſcular motions, and cauſeth <hi>pain.</hi> Sometimes from <hi>flatulency</hi> and wind, getting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> of the Muſcles, thereby cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing intercurrent and fleeting pains.</p>
               <p>And for remedy in ſuch caſes, Fomentations and hot Bags applied are advantageous; Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations being premitted, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Body requiring.</p>
               <p>We come now to conſider of <hi>Pleuriſies</hi> or pains in the Pleura; that inward Membrane that does inveſt or line the Breaſt: a diſeaſe very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and frequently occurring, that both <hi>Hippoc.</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> often mention it by way of example.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>pains</hi> are acute and ſharp like pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; and have no conſtant place, but in ſome perſons they ſeize the right ſide, in others the left; in ſome the pain is higher, in others lower towards the <hi>Hypochonders;</hi> ſometimes more backward, and ſometimes forward: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though chiefly and more manifeſtly the pain be here or there, to be pointed at; yet the whole <hi>Membrane</hi> by reaſon of continuity, is thereby affected, and the parts adjacent do ſuffer by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: from whence various Symptoms, as conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants and attendants, do inſeparably accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and conſort with this <hi>pleuritic</hi> pain.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that difficult and ſhort breathing is conſtantly annexed to it; and this becauſe the parts for reſpiration are hereby impeded, and have not their due motions and liberty of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, but are reſtrained and curbed; which is done in favour, to avoid compreſſing the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49201:40"/>grieved part, otherwiſe would exaſperate and increaſe the pain: and therefore the ſick fetch their breath ſhort and quick, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take it fully and largely, and do repeat it the oftner by way of recompence.</p>
               <p>To this (and by <hi>conſent</hi> of parts) is adioyned a ſhort and dry Cough, which irritates and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes the pain by moving and ſtraining thoſe parts, and therefore is very troubleſom and grievous to the Patient.</p>
               <p>Here alſo a continual acute <hi>Feaver</hi> does ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow as inſeparable: for the <hi>Archaeus</hi> or vital Principle being invaded in thoſe parts by ſomething hoſtile, does therefore inſurge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes inraged, grows hot and fiery, raiſing a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning diſtemper throughout the body.</p>
               <p>To theſe we may add another conſtant <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter;</hi> namely a hard, ſwift, but ſmall Pulſe.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the <hi>pathognomonical</hi> ſignals that are always attending upon, and do diſtinguiſh <hi>Pleuriſies</hi> from other diſeaſes of adjacency or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity and likeneſs with them: for, when pains fall in amongſt the <hi>intercoſtal Muſcles,</hi> although there may be ſome punctures or prickings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Membranes there, yet not ſo great, the <hi>Feaver</hi> not ſo high, nor the breath ſo ſhort, nor the <hi>Cough</hi> ſo troubleſom, if any.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Lungs</hi> be inflamed only, the pain is but little; not punging, but obtuſe; not in the circumference or ſides, but in the <hi>cavity</hi> or mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Breaſt: yet the difficulty of breathing is greater here than in <hi>Pleuriſies,</hi> from anguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49201:41"/>that ſeizeth the parts of reſpiration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pleuriſies</hi> differ from <hi>Inflammations</hi> of the Diaphragma; becauſe in this there is no pain in the ſides, but only at the end of the ſhort Ribs, and the upper part of the Belly is extended; and with it a <hi>Delirium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pleuriſies</hi> alſo are diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi> of the <hi>Liver;</hi> in the ſeat or place of pain, which always is in the right ſide, under the ſhort Ribs; the pain not punging, but heavy and obtuſe; the Cough leſs, difficulty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſs; but the Urine higher-coloured, or tinged red.</p>
               <p>And now I ſee the reaſon (though very weak) why ſome Authors have diſtinguiſhed Pleuriſies or differenced them into legitimate and ſpuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which indeed is a diviſion of <hi>Pleuriſies</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Pleuriſies</hi> and no <hi>Pleuriſies;</hi> for I account no diſeaſe to challenge that denomination, but ſuch as have their foundation in the Pleura: elſe by the ſame reaſon all diſeaſes may admit of the ſame diſtinction of legitimate and ſpurious; for as much as every diſeaſe hath ſome Symptom which is common to other diſeaſes that may give them ſome reſemblance or affinity with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or be affected by conſent from another: but I paſs it over and come to examine the cauſes from whence <hi>pleuritic</hi> pains do ariſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe cauſes are <hi>external,</hi> and <hi>internal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>External</hi> cauſes are ſuch as remotely prepare and diſpoſe the body to a likely capacity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or aptneſs to this diſeaſe, laying the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49201:41"/>foundation for <hi>internal</hi> cauſes; and they do ariſe out of, or from the irregular, unfit or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper uſe of the <hi>Diaetetics,</hi> which leads to a morbific or unſound ſtate.</p>
               <p>For example: violent <hi>exerciſe</hi> or otherwiſe, raiſing great heat in the Body and opening the Pores; by neglect upon it, as not to preſerve that warmth for ſome time, and ſuffering it gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually to abate and go off, by keeping on cloaths and forbearing cool drinks; this may introduce a <hi>Pleuriſie.</hi> So likewiſe in the heat of Summer to throw off cloaths, and be expoſed to the <hi>wind</hi> at a Caſement, or the cool Air in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. To over-heat the Body with ſtrong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, and ſuddenly endeavor to cool it again with ſmall <hi>Beer,</hi> may effect the like. Cold North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds after Southerly, and hot weather, does alter the texture of the blood, and is previous to <hi>pleuritic</hi> or ſimilar pains.</p>
               <p>But here you muſt take notice and know, that <hi>quicquid recipitur, recipitur per modum recipientis;</hi> all Bodies are not alike nor equally diſpoſed for reception; for in ſome theſe cauſes produce <hi>Pleuriſies,</hi> in others <hi>Angina's,</hi> in ſome <hi>Dyſenteries,</hi> in others <hi>Arthritic</hi> pains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the aptitude and diſpoſition of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in fabrication or organization, and peculiar properties, have the ſame general external cauſes various and divers effects; being determined and ſpecificated by different ſtates of Body, more liable and apt to this or that diſeaſe, rather than another. Hence it is that <hi>external</hi> cauſes, as

               <p>
                  <hi>Internal</hi> cauſes, are <hi>antecedent</hi> or <hi>conjunct.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antecedent;</hi> as <hi>plethory,</hi> being fulneſs of blood: or <hi>Cacochymy,</hi> a depraved or degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate blood: both which are previous ſtates or conditions of Body, diſpoſing or rendring more liable to this diſeaſe: for, the great Veſſels being full and diſtended, upon any <hi>Efferveſcence</hi> and <hi>Superfermentation</hi> of the blood, this impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly like a torrent is impelled into the ſmaller Pipes, as thoſe of the <hi>Pleura,</hi> where not having a free paſſage, it does cauſe pain by diſtenſion and <hi>Inflammation.</hi> Now this plenitude is brought on, or aggravated and increaſed, ſometimes by a ſuppreſſion of ſome accuſtomed Evacuation; as thoſe that are wont to diſcharge and abate blood by the <hi>Noſe,</hi> by the <hi>Haemorrhoids</hi> or <hi>Menſtrual</hi> purgations: ſometimes by plentiful feeding, and too much eaſe; ſo that evacuation and tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is not proportionable in abatement and to balance the imported food.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conjunct</hi> cauſes are ſuch as more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and nearly concur or conſpire actually in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of theſe <hi>pleuritic</hi> pains: and they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>acidity,</hi> or <hi>viſcidity</hi> within the Veſſels of the Pleura; or a violent <hi>fluxion</hi> from the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49201:43"/>Veſſels, too great for the capacity and rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of theſe exiguous canals.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Acidity</hi> or an acrid <hi>ſeroſity</hi> does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fabricate and finiſh this diſeaſe by punging and lancinating the Pleura; (for <hi>omne acidum extra ſtomachum corpori eſt hoſtile,</hi> ſays <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>) thereby irritating and exciting the vital ſpirit to eſtuate and be incenſed; and from this <hi>focus</hi> a febrile heat is kindled and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the whole Body: and that oftentimes and for the moſt part, it is a ſharp ſerous humor predominant in the blood which cauſed this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance in the Pleura, is confirmed by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſolution or termination of the diſeaſe, which moſt frequently is by a <hi>ſudorific</hi> evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or <hi>inſenſible</hi> tranſpiration: and therefore <hi>Hippoc.</hi> in his Predictions ſays; <hi>Sudores &amp; u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinas in Pleuritide probè fieri bonum eſſe &amp; ſalutare,</hi> Friendly Sweats and effuſion of Urine preſageth a good event.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Viſcidity,</hi> or <hi>grumoſity</hi> of the blood does ſometimes cauſe <hi>pleuritic</hi> pains; for by obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting thoſe ſmall ductures of the <hi>Pleura</hi> and ſtopping the Circulation, a <hi>Tumor</hi> thereby is raiſed within this double Membrane; for the Veins, Arteries and Nerves lye between theſe two Coats of the <hi>Pleura.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that the blood is thus apt to be <hi>ſtagnant</hi> (eſpecially in the ſmaller Veſſels) by coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, groſſneſs, or congelation, is confirmed by <hi>Phlebotomy;</hi> for being let out of the body, it is ſometimes found deſtitute of its <hi>Serum</hi> or <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex,</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:49201:44"/>that keeps it fluxile, thin and tranſient: and alſo is manifeſt ſo to be when it is in the Veſſels; as in <hi>Gangrenes,</hi> where the blood is fixed and the part almoſt mortified: and when <hi>Pleuriſies</hi> do happen upon this cauſe of concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they commonly tend to <hi>ſuppuration,</hi> as not capable of being diſcuſſed, or put into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a diſcharge of the part.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Blood</hi> becomes thus incraſſated, groſs and viſcous, from every cauſe that does too much exhauſt and expend the <hi>ſeroſity</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; as too great <hi>tranſpiration</hi> or ſweating, or immoderate making of urine: and ſometimes from a malignant, or a venemous <hi>Miaſm</hi> that curdles or congelates the blood.</p>

               <p>Having diſpatched theſe <hi>pleuritic</hi> pains, we are next to take notice what other pains are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to the <hi>Thorax</hi> or Breaſt. And here we find pain to ariſe from <hi>Inflammations</hi> of the <hi>Lungs,</hi> of the <hi>Mediaſtinum,</hi> and of the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma:</hi> whereof an account will be given in their proper places hereafter, when we treat of Inflammations.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Lungs</hi> do ſuffer pain alſo from other cauſes, as from <hi>Tumors</hi> not inflamed; ſometimes from <hi>adheſion</hi> or ſticking of the Lungs to the ſides of the Breaſt: ſometimes from <hi>ſtones</hi> and <hi>worms</hi> that have bred there, obſerved and found upon Diſſections: and ſometimes by <hi>Eroſions</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers,</hi> of which in their due place follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:49201:45"/>
               <p>Back-pains of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> are either upon the <hi>Spine,</hi> between the ſhoulders: or upon the <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulae,</hi> the ſhoulder blades. And theſe pains do ariſe from ſome impreſſions of <hi>cold</hi> lately taken, or from defluxion of a <hi>ſerous</hi> humor from the Head; or ſometimes from a maligne <hi>Miaſm</hi> Venereal or Scorbutic, that infeſts thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pain</hi> ſometimes is ſeated at the bottom of the <hi>Sternum,</hi> between the ſhort Ribs, under the Cartilage <hi>mucronata;</hi> vulgarly called the Pit of the Stomach, but improperly. This <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilage</hi> hangs down, being as it were a defenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the ſubjacent parts, namely the Stomach and Liver; yet is flexible to give way to the extenſions of the ſtomach without compreſſion. This place is very tender at all times, inſomuch that a blow here is ready to make a ſtrong man faint: the part being thus ſenſible, pain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here muſt be very troubleſom. Now this place is of acute ſenſe or feeling, in regard the upper Orifice of the <hi>Stomach</hi> (being very ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous) and almoſt ſubjacent to this <hi>Cartilage,</hi> and the <hi>Heart</hi> adjacent; hence it is that a blow or preſſure here, raiſeth a fainting pain, the Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage yielding and giving way to any force.</p>
               <p>But ſometimes a <hi>pain</hi> is planted here, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways by any external manifeſt cauſe, but from internal, and preternatural ſtate of the parts: and this pain is rarely taken notice of by <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> and mentioned but by a few practical Authors. Now to examine into the cauſe of pain, you muſt know that this Cartilage is flexible and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49201:46"/>yielding in its natural condition, being of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle nature between a Bone and a Ligament, and therefore may be curvated and bent inward up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a threefold account.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Laxation, Exſiccation,</hi> and external <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By <hi>Laxation,</hi> as when too much moiſture reſides here mollifying and looſning the part; from any ſmall occaſion the Cartilage may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexed and turned inward, changing its due po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and rectitude: and from the like cauſe <hi>Ligaments</hi> are ſometimes relaxed, which renders <hi>Junctures</hi> ready and apt for diſlocation and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture; and upon this ſcore the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Spine have been diſplaced; alſo the Hip and Ancles.</item>
                  <item>2. By <hi>Exſiccation</hi> this Cartilage may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorted and wreſted from its poſture: as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that which was ſtraight, green and pliable, by drying and ſhrinking becomes crooked, bent and drawn aſide: So this Cartilage that was a Griſle, tender and pliable, ſometimes becomes dry, hard and bony, and fixed upon diſtortion or writhing, as not returning to its rectitude or ſtraightneſs, and diſtance from the ſubjacent parts, over which and for whoſe guard it is placed.</item>
                  <item>3. By external <hi>Depreſſion,</hi> as from a blow or fall, any thing too much or too long preſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that part, may pervert and alter the ſituation and due poſture: and thoſe whoſe buſineſs or imploy keeps them bending or preſſing forward
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49201:46"/>too much and conſtant, renders them liable to this inconvenience; and therefore Students and Clerks that write much preſſing upon this part are injured thereby, and find it upon age, though youth bears it off for a time.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now ſince this <hi>Cartilage</hi> is thus expoſed to depreſſion and bending inward, and thereby the tender parts ſubjacent to be preſſed upon and moleſted; the cauſe of pain and manner how is made evident: and which moſt commonly is felt after eating and upon a full ſtomach, when the parts are dilated and ſwelling up to this Cartilage. And farther, as all parts of the Body in ſeveral perſons do vary and differ much in <hi>figure, poſition , magnitude</hi> and <hi>diſtance;</hi> ſo thereby ſome are more liable and apt for this pain than others, although ſubject to the ſame external procuring, or internal antecedent cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>And ſo I diſmiſs this particular pain and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and muſt take cognizance briefly of that which is more general upon the whole Breaſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Thorax</hi> or Breaſt ſuffers by <hi>compreſſion</hi> or <hi>conſtriction,</hi> whereby a general obtuſe pain of <hi>anguſtneſs</hi> is perceived, and that chiefly upon inſpiration and drawing in of the breath: and why now more than at another time, is becauſe the inſpired air fills and diſtends the Breaſt, which makes oppoſition to, or reſiſts the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing cauſes.</p>
               <p>Now the cauſe of <hi>anguſtneſs</hi> or coarctation is from the <hi>Genus nervoſum</hi> that gives motion
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49201:47"/>to the Muſcles and other parts of the Breaſt; which Nerves ſometimes are impedited and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, that their functions are not freely exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted: and therefore to this Symptom of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is commonly adjoyned ſhortneſs or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of breathing, upon the ſame ſcore; and ſometimes <hi>spaſms</hi> or convulſive motions. And this complaint of ſtraitneſs or contraction of the Breaſt: does frequently happen to <hi>ſcorbutic</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe <hi>nervous</hi> juyce being degenerate and tainted, their Organ or Veſſels perform not their office duly as they ought, in giving the full mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and extenſion or every part: for, this ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous liquor being fed and ſupplied from the maſs of blood which is <hi>ſcorbutic,</hi> feculent and depauperated in ſpirit, that alſo which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted thence muſt be anſwerable, and of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate nature: ſo then this <hi>nervous</hi> juyce which ſhould be vegete, noble and ſpirituous, for putting the motive faculties into action with vigor and briskneſs, is become <hi>diſpirited,</hi> flat and depraved, and the Organs acted thereby, move heavily and irregularly: ſo that upon inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or filling the Breaſt with Air, the parts do not readily give way by expanſion to let in; hence the Patient feels himſelf girt or ſtrait-laced.</p>
               <p>It remains now in the laſt place, that we finiſh this ſecond diviſion, in examining and ſearching into the nature and cauſes of thoſe pains that more peculiarly and eminently afflict the Heart.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Heart</hi> being a noble (or the nobleſt and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49201:47"/>principal part, is as the Sun of the <hi>Microcoſm,</hi> whoſe irradiating luſtre and beams of vital heat, enlivens and refreſheth all the regions and parts thereof: the Eclipſes, ſtorms and clouds then that happen as the conſequents of its diſtempers and ſufferings, muſt needs be eminent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. This ſupreme Organ that bears the government of vitality, is ſo generally concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all diſeaſes and diſcompoſures of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that few there are but the <hi>Heart</hi> is made ſenſible thereby, and gives notice thereof by variation of the Pulſe, as a ſigrial from thence. And not only diſtempers of the Body, or the defect and decay of ſome particular member or faculty does affect the <hi>Heart;</hi> but alſo the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders and paſſions of the <hi>Mind,</hi> have influence thereon, that from thence the <hi>Heart</hi> akes, beats, or ſuffers pain and reſtleſs diſturbance: hence it is that <hi>grief, anger, fear, deſire,</hi> &amp;c. Changeth the regular motion of the <hi>Heart,</hi> and the Pulſe alters as a token and manifeſt character of its ſufferings.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Heart</hi> is made thus ſenſible of the Bodies infirmities and preternatural mutations, from the vital government that is planted here; having commerce and communication with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry member, from the circulating <hi>afflux</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux</hi> of the crimſon vital ſtream, continually tranſmitted through this Organ, which thereby is affected well or ill, as the <hi>blood</hi> is better or worſe, in the current and quality thereof. And the Heart is alſo affected from the mind; for as
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49201:48"/>much as the Soul exerciſeth her power more eminently here; and if a particular part may bee aſſigned, this may be ſaid to be the ſeat or Throne of Regality.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Heart</hi> being of a ſolid fibrous fleſh, the <hi>pain</hi> thereof is obtuſe, not ſo accurately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible, ſo acute and ſharp, as thoſe of the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous parts: notwithſtanding the effects and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents thereof are impreſſed upon the whole Body, and each member is impaired in its viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and vigor: and although this Heart-<hi>pain</hi> by the nature and ſubſtance of the Organ, is not ſo great commonly and perceptible, as that of ſome other parts; yet when this pain does ariſe to ſome degree, a <hi>Syncope</hi> ſeizeth the, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, a deprivation or ceſſation of life for a time; that what it wants as to ſenſe is doubled in the conſequents, as threatning and endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the life: ſo that extremity of pain is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived here, becauſe ſenſe decays, as the cauſe of pain increaſeth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Heart</hi> is moleſted and ſuffers pain theſe ſeveral ways: by <hi>extenſion, conſtriction, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, inflammation</hi> or intemperate <hi>heat,</hi> Impoſthumation, by <hi>eroſion,</hi> by <hi>exotic</hi> genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Heart</hi> is pained by <hi>extenſion,</hi> from a ſudden ebullition and turgid fermentation of the <hi>blood</hi> raiſed by paſſion, or otherwiſe; whereby the Veſſels are ſuddenly forced upon <hi>diſtenſion</hi> to receive and tranſmit the inundation and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling current of the blood; and from hence pain
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49201:48"/>and trouble ariſeth at the Heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By <hi>conſtriction</hi> the Heart is pained, and that from <hi>external</hi> and <hi>internal</hi> cauſe: exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from the <hi>Pericardium</hi> compreſſing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Heart is denied the full liberty of its <hi>Diaſtole</hi> or expanſion: and this may ariſe upon a double account; either from. the <hi>Pericardium</hi> being too replete and full; or too much <hi>exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted</hi> and empty. You muſt underſtand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that this <hi>Pericardium</hi> or <hi>Capſula cordis,</hi> is a Membrane deſigned by Nature to involve and incloſe the Heart for its defence; as alſo being a moiſt Bath to irrigate and keep it ſouple, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a <hi>Serum</hi> or water; and this Membrane ſhould extend and be enlarged according to the motions of the <hi>Heart</hi> being greater or leſs: now when this water does abound filling the cavity of this incloſure, the Heart thereby is prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted its full expanſion: and <hi>è contrà,</hi> when this water is too much waſted and dryed up, the <hi>Pericardium</hi> cleaves to the <hi>Heart,</hi> and impedes its pulſific motion: thus either plenitude or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity begets anxiety and trouble at the Heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Internal</hi> cauſe of <hi>conſtriction</hi> is, when the Heart it ſelf is ſeized with a <hi>Tabes</hi> or vehement exſiccation, and the fibres ſo contracted, that it hath no capacity, or leſs for dilatation, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the tranſient blood.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Obſtruction</hi> cauſeth <hi>pain</hi> and trouble at Heart, when the free current of the blood is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded from within due Veſſels; and this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured ſometimes from a perturbation of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49201:49"/>ſpirits, and ſometimes from an indiſpoſition of the impulſed blood.</p>
               <p>Firſt, from a ſudden and violent recurrence of <hi>Spirits</hi> from other parts, and tumultuous confluence at the Heart, whereby the circulation is checkt, and the blood ſtopt in the <hi>Ventricles,</hi> cauſing a ſuffocation for a time; and this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens upon vehement paſſions, and conſternations of the mind.</p>
               <p>Secondly, From an inhability and incapacity of the blood being <hi>groſs, concreted</hi> or <hi>grumous,</hi> that it hardly or with difficulty paſſeth through this Organ, cauſing thereby an obtuſe pain, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion or heavineſs at the region of the Heart, and ſometimes a <hi>Lipothymy</hi> or <hi>Syncope,</hi> faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſwooning.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By <hi>Inflammation</hi> or intemperate heat, the Heart is pained; as in moſt <hi>Feavers</hi> where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſneſs of heat is accompanied: and this heat continuing does exſiccate, and contract the heart, and brings a <hi>Tabes</hi> or Conſumption upon the whole Body.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By <hi>Impoſthumation</hi> the Heart is pained ſometimes, as alſo by other <hi>Tumors</hi> there bred, Which by diſſection hath appeared after death.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By <hi>Eroſion</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lceration</hi> ſometimes the <hi>Heart</hi> is pained, and ſuffers by continual palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p n="7">7. By <hi>exotic Generations,</hi> and ſtrange pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions the Heart ſometimes is pained; as when <hi>worms, ſtones</hi> or <hi>bony</hi> ſubſtance is bred in the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of' the Heart; which hath been
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49201:49"/>found there upon diſſection after death: and to theſe diſeaſes, and ſuch as moſt of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, the Symptom of <hi>Palpitation</hi> does neceſſarily belong; ſhewing the continual mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation and trouble the Heart lyes under, who endeavors to acquit and extricate it ſelf by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, lofty and ſtrong pulſations.</p>

               <head>Pains in the <hi>Abdomen</hi> or lower Region of the Body.</head>
               <p>NOW we have done with thoſe pains inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the middle Cavity, namely the <hi>Thorax</hi> or Breaſt: I come in the next place, and by the order propoſed to the lower Region, called the <hi>Abdomen</hi> or Belly, containing the <hi>Stomach, Liver, Spleen, Kidneys,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And here firſt as the principal member we ſhall inquire into pains belonging to the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach</hi> or Ventricle; being the great Office and Laboratory to prepare Aliment to ſupply and maintain the whole Body; therefore if this part be pained and out of order, all the reſt muſt needs fare the worſe for it, every part having a concern from hence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pains</hi> of the Stomach are various both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their cauſes; and alſo from the different parts of the Ventricle where they do infeſt, and thoſe are three; the upper Orifice called <hi>Os</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:49201:50"/>
                  <hi>Ventriculi;</hi> the lower <hi>Orifice</hi> called <hi>Pylorus;</hi> and the whole cavity of the Stomach.</p>
               <p>The upper <hi>Orifice</hi> or mouth of the Stomach is ſubject to great pain, as being very tender and ſenſible, in regard it is very nervous, and this <hi>pain</hi> is the more eminent and remarkable, for that commonly two principal parts are hereby affected and drawn into conſent, the <hi>Brain</hi> and the <hi>Heart:</hi> the former, by the Nerves of the ſixth conjugation derived from the <hi>Brain,</hi> whoſe ramifications are wreathing or twining about this Orifice; and therefore from, hence <hi>Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aches, Vertigoes</hi> and <hi>Epilepſies</hi> do often ariſe. The <hi>Heart</hi> alſo is affected, both in reſpect of <hi>vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> as near adjoyning to this Orifice; and alſo for that the ſame pair of Nerves doth ſerve both the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Stomach,</hi> whereby of neceſſity there muſt be a communication of pain; and therefore it is that this <hi>pain</hi> in extremity cauſeth <hi>Fainting</hi> and <hi>Swooning:</hi> and hence it is that this pain by a peculiar diſtinguiſhing title is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cardialgia;</hi> and alſo for that the ancient Greeks called the mouth of the ſtomach <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>As for the cauſes of this <hi>Cardialgia</hi> or ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach-pain; ſometimes they are ſharp, acrid and hot biting humors, fluctuating and riſing up to the <hi>Orifice</hi> of the ſtomach, where they cauſe an eroding or gnawing pain, and ſometimes a ſcald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or heat there; and this vulgarly is called the <hi>Heart</hi> burning.</p>
               <p>Sometimes <hi>flatulency</hi> and wind cauſeth this <hi>pain</hi> by way of diſtenſion and a ſwelling fulneſs;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49201:50"/>and the Orifice is conſtringed and ſhut up ſo, as denying vent: in this caſe the Patient labours and ſtrains to belch, but cannot unlock or looſen the <hi>Orifice</hi> of the ſtomach; but ſo ſoon as the <hi>Orifice</hi> does ſlacken and give way, the wind breaks forth, and eaſe followeth.</p>
               <p>Sometimes <hi>Worms</hi> do cauſe this pain, having gotten up to the mouth of the <hi>Ventricle,</hi> where they gnaw and bite.</p>
               <p>Sometimes churliſh and deleterious or ill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared <hi>Phyſick;</hi> or diſcordant <hi>food</hi> having ſuch properties as may irritate and provoke this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part: or food received in too great a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, above what the ſtomach is able to maſter and digeſt, then it riſeth up to the mouth of the ſtomach, cauſing oppreſſion and pain there, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it be diſcharged upwards or downwards, by the ſtrength of Nature, or the aſſiſtance of Art.</p>
               <p>Beſides this <hi>Cardialgia,</hi> there is alſo another ſort of pain that afflicts the mouth of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and that is <hi>Singultus</hi> a Hicket, or Hickop: and although the whole Ventricle be moleſted therewith, yet the chief pain or trouble is at the Orifice or mouth of the ſtomach. This <hi>Hickop</hi> is a convulſive motion of the ſtomach, thereby cauſing pain. The general cauſes aſſigned by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> are two, <hi>repletion</hi> and <hi>inanition:</hi> under repletion is comprehended whatever hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor or vapor is in the ſtomach and <hi>diſguſtful,</hi> to irritate and provoke the expulſive faculty: but a <hi>Singultus</hi> by inanition, is a vellication of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49201:51"/>of the retentive faculty, and is the effect of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtion and large evacuations: and accounted more dangerous than the former. Therefore <hi>Hickops</hi> after great vomiting or purging, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick Feavers, and long-waſting ſickneſſes, are very bad ſigns.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a <hi>pain</hi> belonging to the mouth of the ſtomach, which although it be a real pain and properly ſo called (according to the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>dolor</hi>) yet Phyſicians have given it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denomination, and that is Nauſeouſneſs, or a nauſeating ſick pain at the <hi>Orifice</hi> of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. The cauſes of this nauſeating pain are various: as whatever is diſguſtful there, whether it be meat or drink offending in quantity or quality: or indigeſted depraved matter, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licts after former digeſtions, floating upon the ſtomach: or only imbecillity and weakneſs of the ſtomach, being not able to cloſe with and digeſt, although good food be ſent in: and thus it is when the <hi>Tone</hi> of the ſtomach is altered by <hi>intemperance</hi> and ill uſage; by great or long <hi>ſickneſs;</hi> or decayed and worn out by <hi>age.</hi> Sometimes the cauſe is organical, as when a <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> or <hi>Apoſtem</hi> is forming there.</p>
               <p>And not only thus <hi>idiopathically,</hi> but alſo ſometimes the ſtomach complains and nauſeates <hi>ſympathically,</hi> by conſent from other parts, by reaſon of vicinity or communication: and thus a <hi>Tumor</hi> of an adjacent part may moleſt and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the ſtomach: and other remote parts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging and emptying themſelves into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach

               <head>Pains of the <hi>Inteſtines</hi> or Guts.</head>
               <p>HAving gone through thoſe <hi>Pains</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Stomach</hi> or <hi>Ventricle,</hi> in the next place and in order, we come to treat of pains incident to the <hi>Inteſtines</hi> or Guts; being derived from the Ventricle, and are one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued body and paſſage from the <hi>Pylorus</hi> to the <hi>Anus:</hi> notwithſtanding for diſtinction ſake, and becauſe this long cavity is different in ſeveral parts thereof, as to <hi>magnitude, ſubſtance, figure,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49201:52"/>place</hi> and <hi>office;</hi> therefore it is divided into parts, having ſeveral names, for a more diſtinct knowledge, both in relation to the different formation thereof, as alſo to point particularly where a diſeaſe is in any part thereof.</p>
               <p>The diviſion is made into <hi>ſmall</hi> and <hi>great</hi> Guts; the ſmall or thin are three; <hi>Duodenum, jejunum</hi> and <hi>Ileon;</hi> the great or thick are three alſo, <hi>caecum, Colon</hi> and <hi>rectum;</hi> and in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they lye from the Ventricle to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The three firſt are circumvolved about the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbilicus</hi> or Navel, and take up the centre of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> the other are ſubjacent and circumferential.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pains</hi> do frequently moleſt the ſmall Guts, but chiefly the <hi>Ileon;</hi> which when they ariſe to extremity, the diſeaſe is called <hi>Iliaca paſſio,</hi> from that Gut moſt affected.</p>
               <p>The ſeat of theſe <hi>pains</hi> are above the Navel chiefly, extending to the <hi>Hypochonders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>pains</hi> differ in their cauſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome are weak and tranſient, ariſing from <hi>wind</hi> and <hi>acidities,</hi> which cauſe ſome pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, gripes, or diſtenſions, and continue not: but ſometimes theſe pains are more grievous, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon cauſes greater and more contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious; and therefore attended with other Symptoms in great rigor: as <hi>conſtipation</hi> of the Belly, violent <hi>heat, fainting, vomiting</hi> and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up whatever is received; nothing paſſing downwards, but moves upwards, that ſometimes the excrements are voided by the mouth.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:49201:52"/>
               <p>About the cauſes of theſe violent pains <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians</hi> do not concur. The general opinion (taken from <hi>Galen</hi>) will have theſe pains to ariſe from an <hi>Inflammation</hi> of the Guts: others (modern Authors) from a <hi>periſtaltic</hi> motion, or the motion of the Guts inverted: for whereas in the courſe of Nature the expulſive faculty moves downward by a contraction of <hi>Fibres</hi> from the Ventricle to the <hi>Anus è contrà,</hi> in this caſe the <hi>Fibres</hi> contract below and drive upwards.</p>
               <p>But this difference may be reconciled, and neither opinion to be faulted, being rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derftood: for <hi>Inflammation</hi> may begin, and cauſe the motion of the <hi>Inteſtines</hi> which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally tends or moves downwards, to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upwards, by a different contraction of <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres:</hi> So that <hi>Inflammation</hi> cauſeth mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>periſtaltic</hi> motion immediately; and ſets forth the order of cauſation; the one ſuperior, the other ſubordinate. <hi>Quod eſt cauſa cauſae, eſt etiam cauſa cauſati.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the Guts are capable of <hi>Inflammation;</hi> but the ſmall Guts more uſually, as being moſt liable, for having more <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> than the reſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Iliac</hi> pains from <hi>Inflammation</hi> are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous, if they ariſe to a great height; becauſe the <hi>Inflammation</hi> is apt to make a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal tranſition into a <hi>Gangrene:</hi> and indeed all <hi>Inflammations</hi> of the Guts are difficult and doubtful, becauſe they eaſily <hi>gangrene</hi> and <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:49201:53"/>
               <p>And not only <hi>Inflammation</hi> inverts the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Guts, but alſo other cauſes may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get this <hi>Iliac</hi> paſſion, or joyn with it as partial cauſes: as an <hi>Apoſtem</hi> or other ſort of Tumor; a <hi>Rupture,</hi> an <hi>Exulceration,</hi> indurated <hi>Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> cauſing great obſtruction: alſo whatever by compreſſion or conſtriction of the Guts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtipation or coaleſcence, may cauſe contortion, and turn the natural courſe and motion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and of theſe frequent examples in practice do manifeſt and confirm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pains</hi> of affinity and adjacency to the <hi>Ileon,</hi> and which are often complicated therewith, are <hi>Colic</hi> pains, ſo called from the Gut <hi>Colon,</hi> the part wholly or chiefly affected. This Inteſtine is laſt but one, and more capacious than any of the reſt; furniſhed with many little cells or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate receptacles, to receive the excrements and retain them, elſe they would paſs away too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and inconveniently.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Gut</hi> is ſeated almoſt round the <hi>Abdomen</hi> or Belly; ſo that <hi>Colic</hi> pains are not eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by the place, being ſometimes here and ſometimes there; left ſide, right ſide, or under the Ventricle; hence it is that <hi>Colic</hi> pains do counterfeit ſometimes the <hi>ſtone</hi> or pain in the <hi>Kidneys,</hi> left and right, and ſometimes they are ſuppoſed to be pains of the <hi>spleen:</hi> but moſt frequently theſe pains are towards the left ſide near the flank, where the <hi>Colon</hi> is more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, tortuous and circumflected: and therefore when the excrements are hardned in the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49201:53"/>and more capacious part of the <hi>Colon,</hi> and are then forced down by <hi>wind</hi> or otherwiſe, into the narrower, great <hi>pain</hi> muſt needs ariſe thereupon.</p>
               <p>But concerning the cauſes of <hi>Colic</hi>-pains they are various, and may be ranked under theſe Heads.</p>

               <p>By the firſt it appears, that <hi>Obſtruction</hi> in the Guts (which produceth <hi>Colic</hi> pains) does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ariſe from an antecedent obſtruction in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother part: as when the <hi>Meatus cyſticus,</hi> the paſſage of the Gall into the <hi>jejunum</hi> is ſtopt, it cauſeth alſo a ſtoppage in the Guts: for the <hi>Gall</hi> being naturally diſcharged into the <hi>Guts</hi> does ſtimulate them to expulſion, and moves the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements downwards; but for want of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing and provoking matter, the Guts fill up, are obſtructed and diſtended, thereby raiſing <hi>pain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wind</hi> and flatulency begets <hi>Colic</hi>-pains ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; and theſe are not fixed, but roving here
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49201:54"/>and there; and commonly attended with a rumbling and noiſe in the belly: and this is an effect of <hi>crudities</hi> and weak <hi>digeſtion,</hi> riſing from a natural debility, or occaſioned by intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and a bad diet. And this <hi>flatus</hi> is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the cavity of the <hi>Colon</hi> involved in a viſcous tough flegm incloſed as in a Bladder; or ſometimes ſhut up within the <hi>Tunicles</hi> of the <hi>Inteſtine,</hi> where forcing its way out, does cauſe great <hi>pain</hi> in the part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sharpneſs</hi> of an humor indigeſted or degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, does ſometimes cauſe <hi>Colic</hi> pains; and this is either a <hi>mordant</hi> biting <hi>Choler,</hi> or an acid <hi>ſeroſity.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Drineſs</hi> and <hi>hardneſs</hi> of Excrements do cauſe <hi>Colic</hi>-pains ſometimes; for as much as they ſtop the paſſage and extend the <hi>Inteſtines,</hi> denying vent to any ſudden fermenting <hi>humor, wind,</hi> &amp;c. that ſhould freely paſe away. This coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and conſtipation is acquired, by ill diet, in the uſe of hot, dry, aſtrictives: by <hi>watching</hi> or <hi>ſleeping</hi> too much; immoderate <hi>Venus;</hi> by <hi>heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the body, and <hi>ſweating</hi> much, through <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, labour,</hi> intemperate <hi>Air,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are great dryers, and take off the <hi>lubricity</hi> of the Guts, that they perform not their office as they ought: thus excrements not being tranſmitted and ſent away duly, they accumulate, fill up, diſtend and obſtruct the <hi>Inteſtines,</hi> and give great occaſion to <hi>Colic</hi>-pains.</p>

               </list>
               <p>To examine this diviſion in the ſeveral parts thereof, and to ſet forth what truth and errour it contains therein, is not our buſineſs at this time: I ſhall only diſcourſe upon the laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> a Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery being painful and grievous to bear; which kind of bloody Flux ariſeth from, and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with an Exulceration, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the conſequent of long, or ſevere ;<hi>Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoea's;</hi> for thoſe <hi>Fluxes</hi> not being checkt, do ſometimes make their tranſition and terminate in <hi>Dyſenteries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This word <hi>Dyſentery</hi> taking its name from the part affected, imports only a difficulty of the <hi>Inteſtines;</hi> but may as properly be uſed for other diſeaſes and pains there: but <hi>Authors</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fixed it to <hi>bloody</hi> Fluxes from Exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49201:57"/>its general ſignification is reſtrained, and cuſtom amongſt <hi>Phyſicians</hi> hath faſtned it here, as the <hi>character</hi> of this diſeaſe only.</p>
               <p>The parts affected are the <hi>Guts,</hi> either the ſmall or the great, and ſometimes both: but pains of the ſmall are more grievous than thoſe of the great: the ſmall <hi>Guts</hi> being of more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite ſenſe.</p>
               <p>The external and <hi>procatarctic</hi> cauſes that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſe and introduce a <hi>dyſenterical</hi> diſpoſition, or promote and ſet forwards an inclination al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begun, are</p>
               <p>Firſt, the conſtitution of the <hi>Air.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, a bad <hi>Diet</hi> conſpiring therewith, or ſome unwonted kind of <hi>Meats</hi> or <hi>Drinks:</hi> and therefore it is that many people upon the change of <hi>Climate,</hi> and a new ſort of <hi>Food,</hi> do fall into bloody Fluxes: hence it is alſo, that theſe <hi>Fluxes</hi> are ſometimes <hi>epidemical</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, infeſting many together in a City or Country, as of late years in <hi>London,</hi> and ſome other parts of <hi>England,</hi> this diſeaſe was raging. Theſe <hi>epidemical Dyſenteries</hi> ariſe ſometimes to to the height of <hi>peſtiléntial,</hi> and are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, that it is not ſafe to converſe with, or be near the diſeaſed, but eſpecially ſuch as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the ſick are in moſt danger, from the <hi>Excrements</hi> that ſend forth a pernicious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious vapor.</p>
               <p>For the time of the year, <hi>Autumn</hi> is moſt ready, and does more frequently produce theſe Fluxes: partly from the change of the <hi>ſeaſon,</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:49201:58"/>and partly from the effects of Summer-<hi>fruits,</hi> to which many are intemperately given: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents whereof are commonly <hi>Diarrhoea's</hi> and <hi>Dyſenteries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the reaſon why theſe <hi>Fluxes</hi> do break out more frequently at this time of the year is; becauſe the external ambient <hi>Air</hi> and cool blaſts condenſing and incraſſating the <hi>Juyces</hi> of the body, as alſo occluding and ſhutting up the <hi>Pores,</hi> denying and hindring the former <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration</hi> (which in the Summer and hot wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did ſpend and evaporate that way much ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous matter) which <hi>vents</hi> being ſtopt, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors accumulate, ferment and grow turgid, and forceth a diſcharge inwards by the <hi>Guts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And not only this change of <hi>Air</hi> from hot to cold, or Summer-<hi>fruits</hi> are procuring cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; but alſo ſome <hi>aſtral</hi> and inimical influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, drawn in with our breath, may deprave and alter the <hi>Craſis</hi> of the <hi>blood</hi> and nervous <hi>juyce,</hi> as to effect this diſeaſe, and make it popular in like manner as other <hi>Epidemical</hi> diſeaſes are ſometimes procured. Alſo ſome ſorts of Meats in <hi>quantity</hi> or <hi>quality</hi> offending and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and for want of good digeſtion, may corruption and diſpoſe to theſe <hi>Fluxes.</hi> To theſe we may add as procurers, ſome ill prepared <hi>Medicines,</hi> and medicinal Drugs not well corrected that have, and will produce a <hi>Dyſentery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But concerning the proximate cauſe and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of generation of this diſeaſe, we muſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declare: And whereas before we mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49201:58"/>ſeveral ſorts of <hi>bloody</hi> excretions or fluxes not <hi>dolorous,</hi> nor depending upon or conjoyned with exulceration of the <hi>Inteſtines,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not denominated nor to be underſtood as <hi>Dyſenteries</hi> in the ſtrict and preſent ſenſe; therefore I muſt wave the mentioning of their cauſes, and only give an account of <hi>Dyſenteries</hi> in the uſual acceptation of the word.</p>
               <p>In the forming or generating of this <hi>Dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> you muſt underſtand, that ſometimes the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lceration</hi> is planted firſt and hath the prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and a Flux of blood follows as the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent: but ſometimes the voiding of blood precedes, and an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers</hi> is procured thereby as the <hi>effect:</hi> and this conſideration is not of ſmall moment in the deſignment and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of curing; for both the former and the latter happen in ſeveral perſons.</p>
               <p>Sometimes <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lceration</hi> is made by ſharp cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive humors, as in <hi>Diarrhoea's,</hi> which ulcerate the guts firſt, then a Dyſentery of blood fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. Or,</p>
               <p>Sometimes from an <hi>Inflammation</hi> of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, or other <hi>Tumor</hi> coming to ſuppuration, which breaks and makes a <hi>Dyſentery,</hi> ſending forth blood and corrupt matter.</p>
               <p>Sometimes a bloody <hi>Flux</hi> continues a while without <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lceration,</hi> and afterwards <hi>ulcerates</hi> the guts and makes a <hi>Dyſentery:</hi> that is, when this extravaſated blood lodging in the guts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates and putrifies, it does thereby erode and plant an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer,</hi> which compleats a <hi>Dyſentery.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:49201:59"/>
               <p>Now this kind of <hi>Dyſentery</hi> ariſeth from an impurity or corruption of the <hi>blood,</hi> which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a preternatural fermentation or efferveſcence in the whole maſs; but Nature not being able to depurate and ſeparate from this degenerate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture, either by <hi>Tranſpiration</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> is forced upon this emiſſion by the <hi>Inteſtines</hi> without a ſecretion, and throws out both the good and bad together.</p>
               <p>In the proſecution of Cure, as theſe cauſes are rightly adjudged, and Medicines adapted thereto, depends the ſucceſs: and therefore that courſe and Method which is advantageous and proper to one, may be injurious and altogether diſagreeing to another.</p>
               <p>And here you muſt take notice , that <hi>Dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries</hi> are ſometimes malignant (as commonly when <hi>Epidemical</hi>) and then <hi>Alexipharmacal</hi> Medicines are not to be omitted.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the degrees of <hi>Dyſenteries,</hi> as to a better and worſe, curable or deplorable ſtate, and the ſignals declaring them; as alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Queries</hi> that might be raiſed, and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction given to each; the conciſeneſs of this Work will not admit to inlarge thereon.</p>
               <p>In the next place and of great affinity with <hi>Dyſenteries</hi> is a <hi>Teneſmus;</hi> agreeing in the cauſes and Symptoms, but differing in the part affected; a <hi>Teneſmus</hi> being ſeated at the lower end of the right Gut or Fundament.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Etymologie</hi> of the word imports ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49201:59"/>of the nature of the diſeaſe, being a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent deſire and ſtraining downwards to the ſtool; but inſtead of excrements, blood and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous matter is brought forth, and with great pain. This ariſeth from an Ulceration of the laſt Inteſtine procured from the ſame cauſes as Dyſenteries, which we need not repeat.</p>
               <p>This diſeaſe is moſt dangerous to women with child, for that it cauſeth abortion: but to all perſons it is very troubleſom and painful; and if it continues long, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer</hi> becomes <hi>fiſtulous,</hi> and difficult to be cured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">And now I remember the Cure of an old <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer</hi> in this part, notwithſtanding the contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and difficulty thereof. In the year 1653. when I was but a young <hi>Practiſer;</hi> yet by the bleſſing of <hi>God</hi> upon my endeavors I cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Gentlewoman afflicted with an Ulcer <hi>in ano</hi> for ſeven years; who could not in all that time receive help, though ſhe had tryed many <hi>Phyſicians</hi> and <hi>Chirurgions,</hi> having a plentiful Fortune to allow it. She was aged between fifty and ſixty, an <hi>Aldermans</hi> Wife of <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filde</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> where I happened to ſtay in that Town for ſome time, whereby this <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman</hi> beyond her expectation, received a perfect Cure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To finiſh our Diſcourſe of <hi>Pains</hi> belonging to the Inteſtines, we ſhall conclude with the <hi>Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoids.</hi> A diſeaſe frequent, and ſometimes of great complaint.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Haemorrhois</hi> ſignifies a Flux of <hi>Blood</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:49201:60"/>in general; but cuſtom hath reſtrained it, and amongſt <hi>Phyſicians</hi> it is uſed and underſtood only, that effuſion of blood by the <hi>Haemorrhoid</hi> Veins, which Veins terminate at the lower end of the laſt <hi>Inteſtine,</hi> and about the Fundament.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Haemorrhoid</hi> Veins are internal and external; although moſt of the Ancients and ſome modern Authors acknowledge only the internal, but erroneouſly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>external</hi> Haemorrhoid Veins do differ much.</p>
               <p>As <hi>firſt,</hi> in their <hi>riſe</hi> or <hi>deſcent:</hi> for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal do proceed from the <hi>Hypogaſtric</hi> branch of the <hi>Vena cava;</hi> and the internal from the <hi>Vena portae;</hi> and commonly from the ſplenical branch thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> in <hi>number;</hi> the internal being but one, though orbicularly multiplied and divided about the <hi>Anus.</hi> The external are threefold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in their <hi>inſertions:</hi> the internal being inſerted into the <hi>membranous</hi> ſubſtance of the right Gut: the external into the <hi>muſculous</hi> ſubſtance of the <hi>Anus</hi> or Fundament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> they differ in their <hi>contents:</hi> the internal carrying a groſs and blacker blood: the external more thin, and ruddy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> in their <hi>office</hi> and <hi>uſe:</hi> the internal evacuates the <hi>Vena porta,</hi> and <hi>ſplenical</hi> Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, thereby advantageous in ſome diſeaſes of the <hi>Spleen,</hi> and <hi>Cacochymies.</hi> The external do em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> and correct ſuch diſeaſes that depend upon <hi>Plethory</hi> or redundance.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:49201:60"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> they differ in <hi>evacuation:</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal not ſo copious: the external commonly large in the profuſion, and ſometimes very inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and to ſome <hi>mortal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> in <hi>pain:</hi> the internal for the moſt part painful; the external not, in evacuation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> they differ in <hi>aſſociation:</hi> the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> deſcending without Arteries: the <hi>extern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> are adjoyned with Arteries to the <hi>Anus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Haemorrhoid</hi> Veins are liable to contrary affects, and the diſeaſed do ſuffer in a different way: ſometimes theſe <hi>Veins</hi> abound with blood and ſwell for want of apertion, and a diſcharge; and this is called the blind <hi>Haemorrhoids: è con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trà,</hi> ſometimes the mouths of theſe <hi>Veins</hi> do open and pour out too plentifully, either ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, or by too long continuance; and this is called the open <hi>Haemorrhoids.</hi> Both theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes are grievous to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>The ſwelling of the <hi>Haemorrhoid</hi> Veins, and pains from thence, have the ſame cauſes as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke and continue the <hi>Haemorrhoidal</hi> Flux: <hi>viz.</hi> blood offending in <hi>quantity</hi> or <hi>quality,</hi> which if it find not vent by the terminations or mouths of the Veins, they are extended and ſwell big, and ſometimes inflame; which if it continue is dangerous, leſt it become <hi>cancerous</hi> and <hi>gangrene.</hi> On the other ſide, an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Flux is very pernicious and induceth <hi>Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſies, Conſumptions, Cachexies,</hi> &amp;c. by exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the treaſury of life.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Haemorrhoidal</hi> Fluxes continuing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49201:61"/>and injuriouſly, argue the blood to be hot and ſharp, or too thin abounding with an acrid <hi>ſeroſity,</hi> which provokes the expulſive faculty, and opens the mouths of the Veins. But the blind ſwelling <hi>Haemorrhoids</hi> denote the blood to be groſs and thick, or the coats that cover the extreme ends or mouths of thoſe <hi>Veins,</hi> to be denſe and impenetrable, not permitting an exſudation.</p>
               <p>Here it may be queried, how it comes to paſs, that theſe <hi>Haemorrhoid</hi> Veins ſhould be more troubled with blood, and more frequently ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer an <hi>apertion,</hi> ſince many other places of the body receive the extremities or terminations of the Veins, and ſo equally capable of effuſion.</p>
               <p>In anſwer hereunto you muſt underſtand, that although Nature hath formed the like, and planted them in divers parts of the body, which ſometimes, though more rarely, do iſſue and ſend forth blood; yet theſe <hi>Haemorrhoids</hi> are placed more commodiouſly for voiding of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous and feculent <hi>blood,</hi> being near the common vent and outlet for excrements to paſs away; and their ſituation being downwards, together with the ſtraining upon occaſions at the ſtool, the extremities of theſe Veins are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſometimes forced to evacuate more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently than others.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the blind <hi>Haemorrhoids</hi> you may take notice, and know that there is this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: ſometimes the <hi>Tumor</hi> or extenſion is in the <hi>trunk</hi> or cavity of the Veins, and then there
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49201:61"/>is no apertion; and ſometimes the extuberance is out of the Veins: that is, when the <hi>extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated</hi> blood is lodged between the mouths or terminations of the Veins, and the covering coats. In the former caſe, and when the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Haemorrhoid</hi> Veins be ſo affected, <hi>Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> may alleviate, make a revulſion, and draw away the plenitude; but in the latter it gives no relief; for the <hi>extravaſated</hi> blood will not return into its <hi>canal</hi> or pipe again; and beſides it ſoon coagulates and putrifies out of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, the proper place, and then <hi>ſuppuration</hi> is to be promoted, the <hi>Apoſtem</hi> to be broken, after that abſterſion and healing to be deſigned and endeavoured.</p>
               <p>And here you may diſcern the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two <hi>Haemorrhoid</hi> painful ſwellings, that the firſt kind does abate and retire of its own accord ſometimes, Nature retracting and turning the current of <hi>blood</hi> to ſome other part, at leaſt it ſooner yields to means, and is more eaſily remedied: but the latter will not revert, nor is eaſily cured; but proceeds to <hi>Apoſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and after breaking ſends forth corrupt and bloody matter.</p>
               <p>From hence you may perceive, that as there are many ſorts of <hi>Haemorrhoids,</hi> ſo many que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions might here be ſtarted, and much more to be ſaid concerning them to compleat the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe thereof: as why the <hi>Hemorrhoids</hi> ſhould ſwell and not bleed ſometimes? Why they are <hi>painful,</hi> and ſometimes not? Why they <hi>appear</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:49201:62"/>and paſs away without injury ſometimes? What difference between an <hi>Inflation</hi> and <hi>Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of the <hi>Haemorrhoids?</hi> &amp;c. But to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large hereon and give full ſatisfaction, would ſwell this Work beyond intention and our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits ſet at this time.</p>

               <p>And the <hi>Pancreas</hi> for the moſt part incurs prejudice, being obſtructed or <hi>ſcirrhous,</hi> from an ill affected <hi>Spleen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is, that the <hi>Spleen</hi> challengeth a great ſhare in the production of divers <hi>Cachexies</hi> or ill habits of body, <hi>Dropſies, Scorbute,</hi> black <hi>Jaundice, Haemorrhoids, Cancers,</hi> &amp;c. of which I might give you many examples: but I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite one only, and that very eminent, plainly ſhewing, that the riſe thereof and dependence is ſometimes from the Spleen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">In the year 1658. a <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Woman named <hi>Elizabeth Swaine,</hi> a Farmers Wife, aged 39 years, came to me at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> where I then practiſed, ſhe living about a dozen miles off; her complaint was of pain, hardneſs and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of the Spleen: before which happened,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49201:63"/>ſhe had a tertian Ague for ſome time; but after that had left her, the left ſide began to ſwell, and pain upon the region of the Spleen: this increaſing, and when ſhe came to me the Tumor was raiſed very high, and the compaſs of a penny-loaf, being very hard and ſcirrhous, not yielding when it was preſſed with a finger. Her deſire was to be under my care, and I was willing to undertake the Cure; but ſhe not having brought conveniencies with her to ſtay, would go home and return ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily with ſuch neceſſaries as ſhe ſhould want; but came not again until three months after; and then not only the left Hypochonder, but the Abdomen, her whole belly was tumified and extended as big as if ſhe were ready to be delivered of a child: ſo that the Tumor of the Spleen was then hid, the whole belly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equally raiſed up to it by a Dropſie Aſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. This neglect of hers, and thereby render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cure much more difficult and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, made me to refuſe medling with her, ſince by her folly ſhe had loſt the opportunity; for I was doubtful and feared that the Spleen by that time was become ſcirrhous, and the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor not to be diſcuſſed, or otherwiſe decayed and putrified as not be reſtored: but ſhe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Siſter living in that City, who had been my Patient before, upon both their importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate intreaties (though I would give little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement) I unwillingly did put her into a courſe of Phyſick; but after I began I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured

               <p>After which one purging <hi>Potion</hi> was given, and an <hi>Emplaſter</hi> applied to the Spleen, and then both the <hi>Spleen</hi> and <hi>Abdomen,</hi> the whole belly as flat and ſoft as ever ſhe was, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured, and returned home. All which was performed in the ſpace of about ſeven weeks: and two months after ſhe conceived with child, as I was informed by her relations; and ſhe ſtood firm in health long after. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſucceſs was very good, and the Medicines well deſigned, as ſuch preparations will afford; yet in the like caſes I do not uſe the ſame now.</p>
               <p>This in ſhort; and I could not rehearſe the particulars ſo exactly (being twenty years ſince) but that I have the whole ſtory, with the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Medicines,</hi> in writing now by me: and this I have related to confirm what I aſſerted here
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49201:65"/>before, that a diſeaſed <hi>Spleen</hi> may lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for, and introduce a <hi>Dropſie:</hi> and now I proceed on to ſet forth the cauſes of a pained <hi>Spleen;</hi> which being rightly ſtated, applications may more ſucceſsfully be made in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</p>
               <p>The moſt frequent and apparent Symptom that afflicts the <hi>Spleen</hi> is <hi>Pain;</hi> and this doth ariſe and depend upon ſome of theſe ſeveral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; <hi>Obſtruction, Tumor, Inflammation, Apoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, Compreſſion, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lceration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſtruction</hi> in ſome of the Veſſels of the <hi>Spleen,</hi> is a frequent cauſe that produceth <hi>pain;</hi> and this obſtruction is procured from a feculen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and groſſneſs of blood, which ariſeth either from a natural debility of the <hi>Spleen</hi> not able to perform its office duly; or occaſioned by a melancholy diſpoſition, a ſtudious, ſedentary, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active, or a careful and afflicted life; to which, or ſingly, an evil bad diet and irregular <hi>diaete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic</hi> cuſtoms may contribute, or effect: (as more fully you may be informed in a late <hi>Tract</hi> of mine, entituled, <hi>The Preſervation of Health and Prolongation of Life.</hi>) All which impedes the due fermentation and volatization of the <hi>blood</hi> in the <hi>Spleen,</hi> from whence it becomes thick and foul, and begets a ſtoppage, or too ſlow a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fulneſs in thoſe Veſſels.</p>
               <p>And whereas the office of the <hi>Spleen</hi> (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determined) is to ferment anew, <hi>ſpiritalize,</hi> exalt and rarifie the thick, indigeſted and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy <hi>blood,</hi> ſent thither for a farther ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boration
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49201:65"/>and depuration; it is moſt rational that this not being performed (from ſome of the impediments aforeſaid) <hi>obſtruction</hi> and <hi>ſtagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> there will be the conſequent; and the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient</hi> from hence will feel a pain and heavineſs about thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>But for a more promptneſs or aptneſs to theſe <hi>obſtructions,</hi> anguſtneſs and ſtraitneſs of the Veſſels, ſo formed by Nature, does render ſome perſons more prone than others to <hi>obſtruction</hi> and theſe <hi>ſplenetic</hi> pains.</p>
               <p>And farther, this <hi>obſtruction</hi> does ariſe not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways from the cauſes aforeſaid; but ſometimes from a <hi>compreſſion</hi> of other parts adjacent that may incommode and offend the <hi>Spleen,</hi> or by <hi>contuſion</hi> from a blow or fall; or by an injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>dreſs</hi> and too ſtrait lacing or girding, as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently amongſt the female <hi>Sex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>obſtructions</hi> when continuing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious, are ſo aggravated and increaſed with additional influx, that they form a <hi>Tumor:</hi> this diſtenſion being perceptible by ſight ſometimes, but always by ſeeling, is to be adjudged and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed; whether ſoft and <hi>flatuous,</hi> or hard and <hi>ſcirrhous;</hi> the former ſooner yielding to means, but the latter more difficult of cure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inflammation,</hi> though rarely, yet ſometimes does affect the <hi>Spleen;</hi> and this inflammation does ariſe from <hi>obſtruction;</hi> for the blood being ſtopt in its current and paſſage, and upon ſome extraordinary cauſes being more hot and fiery, does make a ſudden ebullition and inflame, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49201:66"/>great <hi>pain,</hi> heat and extenſion; and this pain is diſtinguiſhed by <hi>pulſation</hi> and beating of the part, having many Arteries. This Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation not rightly applied unto by diligent and good means, does make tranſition, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth into <hi>Apoſtemation;</hi> and ſometimes termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in a <hi>ſcirrhous</hi> Tumor: but theſe two dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous commutations are to be prevented with great care and induſtry: therefore before the diſeaſe arrives to this height, and when only pain or heavineſs gives warning, and tells you of a diſtempered <hi>Spleen,</hi> it is then moſt ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and opportune to apply the means; and then a little may prevent that, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards perhaps a great deal cannot cure.</p>
               <p>And firſt the procuring cauſes, if any there be apparent, are to be avoided; as a <hi>ſedentary</hi> ſlothful life, <hi>intemperance</hi> and groſs feeding, or unſeaſonable eating, as late ſuppers; immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>ſtudy, melancholy, grief</hi> or <hi>care;</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce ſometimes, but always contribute to aggravate <hi>ſplenetic</hi> diſtempers: and although a natural debility and infirm conſtitution of the <hi>Spleen,</hi> may procure the effects aforeſaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other provocations, yet moſt frequently they are ſo cauſed, at leaſt much heightned thereby; and therefore for prevention, as alſo for cure, thoſe injurious habits are to be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and ſuch a <hi>diaetetic</hi> courſe of life obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as may check this diſpoſition of body, as at large you may be directed in the fore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Book, The preſervation of <hi>Health</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longation of <hi>Life,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:49201:66"/>
               <p>For <hi>Pharmaceutic</hi> Remedies (that are made publick) I ſhall commend the aperitive Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Mars; Pil. Antihypochondriac.

               <p>BEfore I inquire into the nature and cauſes of theſe pains, it will be neceſſary to let you know, the <hi>office</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> of this member, its <hi>ſituation, figure</hi> and <hi>veſſels;</hi> for hereby the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe (upon which pains depend) will be more manifeſt and apparent, as alſo ſuch parts as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by vicinity, connexion and conſent from hence.</p>
               <p>To enumerate the various Opinions that have been held by Learned men in all Ages, concerning the <hi>office</hi> of this member, would be too tedious; therefore I ſhall only mention what latter diſcoveries have proved moſt ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from the motion of the <hi>Chyle</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> which is this: That the <hi>Liver</hi> primarily is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to receive the blood coming from the Heart, to give it a farther digeſtion and depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by ſeparating the <hi>bilious</hi> matter; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily, by embracing the <hi>Ventricle,</hi> to cheriſh and promote the ſtomachs digeſtion, or chylifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49201:67"/>for which purpoſes this member is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeated, formed and furniſhed with veſſels to import and export.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Liver</hi> is placed in the right <hi>Hypochonder</hi> under the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> covered in part by the ſhort Ribs, and covering the upper and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the <hi>Ventricle:</hi> and for firmneſs of ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is faſtned by three Ligaments, to the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen,</hi> to the Cartilage <hi>enſiformis,</hi> and to the <hi>Diaphragma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>figure</hi> of this member upon the ſuperior part is convex or round, the better to give way to the motion of the <hi>Diaphragma;</hi> but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſide is concave or hollow, fitly to apply to the extenſion of the <hi>Ventricle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>magnitude,</hi> it is various in divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, greater and leſs: and alſo different in the ſame perſons, in health and ſickneſs: this mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſometimes being waſted and ſhrunk; and ſometimes ſwelled or increaſed wonderfully big.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Organ</hi> hath veſſels appertaining to it, as <hi>Veins, Arteries</hi> and <hi>Nerves:</hi> the two eminent great Veins of mans Body, <hi>Vena cava</hi> and <hi>Vena portae,</hi> having their roots variouſly diſperſed here through the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> or body of the <hi>Liver;</hi> the trunk of the former riſing out of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior gibbous part; the latter from the concave and under-ſide.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Liver</hi> being deſigned for the uſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, ſeated and accommodated after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; we ſhall inquire into the impediments and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49201:67"/>preternatural conditions, from whence pain and trouble ariſeth: for many complain of pain and heavineſs in their right ſide, about the ſhort Ribs, ſometimes more forward, ſometimes back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſometimes inward, and ſometimes more outward. To what parts theſe <hi>pains</hi> belong, and the <hi>cauſes</hi> from whence they ariſe, is worth our labour to be reſolved: for ſometimes pains of the <hi>Liver</hi> have erroneouſly been taken for <hi>Pleuriſies,</hi> becauſe the pain hath extended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and affected the <hi>Thorax,</hi> by reaſon of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity: and ſometimes the <hi>muſcular</hi> pains of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> in the right <hi>Hypochonder,</hi> have been adjudged to be <hi>hepatic,</hi> not rightly diſcerning the <hi>diagnoſtic</hi> ſigns.</p>
               <p>Diſeaſes which the <hi>Liver</hi> is moſt ſubject to, and procuring pain, are theſe: <hi>Obſtruction, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion, Inflammation, Inflation, ſcirrhous</hi> Tumors, <hi>Apoſtems, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers.</hi> From hence we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that as theſe pains are various in their cauſes, ſo are they diſſimilar and unlike in the ſenſe of feeling, and differently ſeated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſtructions</hi> that impede and injure the office of the <hi>Liver,</hi> and producing pain are frequent; and theſe are either in the outmoſt gibbous part, and do belong to the trunk of the <hi>Vena cava:</hi> or elſe in the hollow inferior part, and the <hi>Vena portae</hi> is concerned herein: or elſe the <hi>obſtructions</hi> are fixed in the body of the Liver, and then the ſmall <hi>ramifications</hi> of either or both Veins are affected. Hence it is, that this member is moſt frequently infeſted with <hi>obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:49201:68"/>becauſe it is ſtored with ſo many veſſels as none more.</p>
               <p>But beſides theſe <hi>obſtructions</hi> of the Veſſels, there are alſo <hi>obſtructions</hi> in the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> or ſubſtance of this Organ; that is, when the ſmall <hi>Meatus</hi> or <hi>Pores</hi> are ſhut up, that ventilation and tranſpiration is denied: hence it is, that this member ſometimes is preternaturally extended and increaſed in magnitude, through all its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions: for having a continual ſupply of addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional matter, and not duly expended, the part of neceſſity muſt be augmented and inlarged. And it is obſerved by ſome, that thoſe have the greateſt <hi>Livers,</hi> that are of a colder tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſuch as are great eaters: of this <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Gemma</hi> gives an example of an Old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that could not forbear eating and drinking ſcarce a moment but with great trouble and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh; and being opened after her death, her <hi>Liver</hi> was found to be wonderfully big.</p>
               <p>Signals declaring the <hi>Liver</hi> to be obſtructed are; a <hi>heavineſs, fulneſs,</hi> or an obtuſe <hi>pain</hi> in the right <hi>Hypochonder;</hi> and chiefly after meat, or exerciſe; and upon more than ordinary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the face is apt to be high-coloured, the hands to look red, and the breath to be ſhort, and they are apt to be <hi>feaveriſh</hi> upon ſmall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; but upon reſt and eaſe commonly they are inclined to be pale.</p>
               <p>Cauſes from whence theſe <hi>obſtructions</hi> ariſe and do depend, are; firſt, ſuch as remotely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; as a plentiful and bad <hi>Diet,</hi> or a groſs
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49201:68"/>feeding upon ſuch meats as are difficult to be digeſted and diſtributed (what thoſe are, you will find in the Preſervation of <hi>Health,</hi> &amp;c.) alſo a thick unwholeſom <hi>Air,</hi> to be without exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and to indulge <hi>ſleep</hi> too much; which over-clogs the body, makes a <hi>Plethory</hi> and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whereby the circulation is retarded, laying the foundation and an aptneſs for obſtructions in general.</p>
               <p>Secondly and more immediately; from a <hi>viſcidity</hi> and groſſneſs of the <hi>blood,</hi> rendring it influid, ſlow of motion, and apt to ſtop in the veſſels: and this is generated in the Liver from its diſtemper, debility and decay of the faculty; or is tranſmitted from other parts, and brought in from the antecedent cauſes aforeſaid: to which we may add anguſtneſs of the veſſels in ſome perſons diſpoſing to this inconvenience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſtructions</hi> of the <hi>Liver</hi> are carefully to be lookt after and removed; becauſe they intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce many other diſeaſes, as <hi>Jaundice, Dropſies, Feavers, Inflammations, ſcirrhous</hi> Tumors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adheſion</hi> or <hi>Coaleſcence</hi> ſometimes is the cauſe of <hi>pain</hi> in the right <hi>Hypochonder:</hi> as when the Liver ſticketh to, or groweth together with the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi> And this may happen from too much and conſtant lying on the right ſide; or by the magnitude of the Liver extending to the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> whether tumified preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, or increaſed by a natural nutrition and growth.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>pain</hi> ariſeth hence: the <hi>Membrane</hi> that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49201:69"/>inveſts and covers the <hi>Liver</hi> being very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as all Membranes are; that cleaving to the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> is diſturbed and ſtrained by motion or ſhaking of the body; or by lying on the contrary ſide, the weight of the <hi>Liver</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring a ſeparation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inflammation</hi> ſometimes ſeizeth the <hi>Liver,</hi> and cauſeth great <hi>pain:</hi> and this commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from, or is the conſequent of <hi>obſtructions:</hi> for the blood being ſtopt in its current, and overflowing, eſpecially being more hot and fiery, is then apt to inflame the part: and this is manifeſt to ſenſe, by heat and tenſion of the right <hi>Hypochonder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inflammation</hi> is known from other diſeaſes of the <hi>Liver,</hi> by the vehemency of the Symptoms that attend this more than in other caſes; for the <hi>pain</hi> is greater, the <hi>Feaver</hi> higher, and other <hi>Symptoms</hi> more fierce and ſharp.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Inflammation</hi> be upon the ſuperior gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bous part of the <hi>Liver,</hi> it counterfeits a <hi>Pleuriſie,</hi> and affects the breaſt much, by ſhort breath and a dry Cough; the Tumor then extending to the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> the Vitals are moſt affected, and pain reacheth up to the <hi>Jugulum</hi> ſometimes: but if it be in the cavous inferior parts, then the <hi>Stomach</hi> is moſt ſenſible thereof, by great thirſt, nauſeating or vomiting.</p>
               <p>But leſt you be miſtaken between an <hi>Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of the gibbous part of the <hi>Liver,</hi> and that of the <hi>Muſcles,</hi> you muſt obſerve the difference by ſight and feeling: that the former hath its
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49201:69"/>extenſion circular according to the figure of the <hi>Liver;</hi> but the latter not: beſides the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer may be perceived to lye deeper; the other a more ſuperficial diſtenſion.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Inflammation</hi> be in the body or fleſh of the <hi>Liver,</hi> the pain is obtuſe and heavy: but if the <hi>Membrane</hi> inveſting be the ſeat of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation,</hi> the <hi>pain</hi> is more ſharp and pung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inflammations</hi> are better or worſe, as the blood is good or bad; for according to the degrees of pravity and goodneſs, the <hi>Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> varies; and therefore a <hi>Phlegmon</hi> is not ſo vehement as an <hi>Eryſipelas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inflammations</hi> are very cautiouſly to be dealt with, both in regard of the preſent danger, as alſo for future conſequents: for if a right courſe be not obſerved in the Cure, although the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient may eſcape the acute ſickneſs, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; yet he may fall into a <hi>Dropſie</hi> or <hi>Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi> and that perhaps incurable; the <hi>Liver</hi> being ſo decayed and <hi>tabefied,</hi> as not to be reduced to ſoundneſs: hence it is, that after <hi>Inflammation, Apoſtemation</hi> ſo frequently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, or a <hi>ſcirrhous</hi> Tumor.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Inflammation</hi> terminate in, or leave an <hi>Apoſtem</hi> behind it; if it be deep in the <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma</hi> of the Liver, it is more deſperate: but if the <hi>Apoſtem</hi> or <hi>Abſceſs</hi> lyes between the fleſh and the covering Coat of the Liver, their caſe is more hopeful: becauſe the matter may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcharged, and the Liver not in ſo much danger.</p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:49201:70"/>
               <p>Concerning the termination of this <hi>Phlegmon</hi> or <hi>Inflammation;</hi> either it ſpends it ſelf and goes off by reſolution; or it arrives to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; or it ends in a <hi>ſcirrhous</hi> hard Tumor. The firſt is only deſired, and that which all <hi>Practiſers</hi> ſhould aim at in the adminiſtration and application of Medicines: the two latter are doubtful and dangerous. In the beginning therefore, <hi>Diſcuſſives</hi> and <hi>Diaphoretic</hi> reſolvers are the chief means to oppoſe this diſeaſe; not neglecting to abate <hi>Plethory,</hi> and to make eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, thereby to retract and withdraw fuel from the fire.</p>
               <p>But if the <hi>Apoſtem</hi> cannot be diſcuſſed, then the beſt way is to bring it to <hi>ſuppuration</hi> as ſoon as may be, left the part <hi>gangrene:</hi> and if the faculty of the <hi>Liver</hi> be ſtrong to digeſt and beget a laudable white <hi>Pus</hi> or matter, then there may be hopes of the Patients recovery; but if it be ſordid and ſtinking, the caſe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate. This matter is evacuated ſometimes by ſtool, and ſometimes by Urine; but if it fall into the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> ſection muſt be made to let it out, if Nature cannot diſcharge it other ways. <hi>Natura in ſtatu praeternaturali ab interitu ſe libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratura ſaepe mirabiles quaerit vias ac meatus.</hi> Moe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Apoſtem</hi> being thus generated, and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to <hi>ſuppuration,</hi> it breaks, and then the Scene is changed; for now it becomes an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> and challengeth that denomination. But an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer</hi> is generated ſometimes without <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation,</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:49201:70"/>by ſharp eroding humors, which is not ſo dangerous as the other; becauſe it comes on gradually, the Symptoms milder, and gives more time for the uſe of means.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Apoſtem</hi> likewiſe is gathering in the <hi>Liver</hi> ſometimes without <hi>Inflammation;</hi> is not then ſo painful, nor comes to its height ſo ſoon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apoſtems</hi> do not always come to <hi>ſuppuration,</hi> but ſometimes they grow hard and <hi>ſcirrhous:</hi> and ſuch Tumors the <hi>Liver,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Spleen</hi> are ſubject to.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>ſcirrhous</hi> Tumors do depend upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted matter that will not be diſcuſſed; and are the conſequents of <hi>Inflammations</hi> or invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>obſtrictions;</hi> procured ſometimes by an ill management of their intended Cures, drawing away the thinner matter, and leaving the groſſer behind; as by the uſe of too great dryers and heaters: or by refrigerating and conſtringing Medicines, do ſo incraſſate the humors as not to be reſolved.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Scirrhus</hi> of the <hi>Liver</hi> is painful in the beginning before it come to be exquiſite and confirmed; but afterwards not: and that which is with pain is more hopeful; the other deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, becauſe it is in the way to <hi>gangrene.</hi> Thoſe that are thus affected, lye more eaſie on their right ſide than on the left; in regard the weight of the <hi>Liver</hi> preſſeth upon the <hi>Ventricle,</hi> when they are upon the left.</p>
               <p>You are to take notice, that <hi>pains</hi> of this <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> and alſo from other Tumors of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:49201:71"/>or <hi>obſtructions,</hi> do not always poſſeſs the right ſide, but <hi>pain</hi> is felt ſometimes forward up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the region of the <hi>Stomach;</hi> for as much as one part of the <hi>Liver</hi> lyes forward upon the <hi>Ventricle:</hi> hence it is that many are miſtaken ſometimes, in judging all pains about the region of the <hi>Stomach</hi> to be pains of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> when indeed they are ſeated in the left part of the Liver.</p>
               <p>There is alſo an <hi>Inflation</hi> of the <hi>Liver,</hi> which is a <hi>Tumor</hi> or extenſion thereof, from <hi>wind</hi> and flatulent humors, ſometimes in the veſſels, and ſometimes lodged between the inveſting Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane and the <hi>Parenchyma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Tumor</hi> is not hard, but yields to preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; the <hi>pain</hi> from hence is mutable, ſhifting its place, greater and leſs, ſometimes ceaſing, but returning by intervals.</p>
               <p>There are alſo other cauſes that have and may produce <hi>pains</hi> of the <hi>Liver;</hi> as <hi>ſtones</hi> and <hi>worms,</hi> which have been found upon diſſection: but being more rare, and ſcarce to be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but after death, I wave the proſecution thereof, and paſs on to the next conſiderable part.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Reins</hi> or <hi>Kidneys</hi> are two, placed one of either ſide the <hi>Spine</hi> or Back-bone, about the lower ſhort Ribs, the one under ſome part of the <hi>Liver,</hi> the other under the <hi>Spleen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſtructure of the Kidneys, the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable for our purpoſe, are the <hi>Cavities</hi> and <hi>Ductures</hi> in the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> or body of them, and the Veſſels leading to and from. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the is much like to that of the <hi>Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two <hi>Cavities</hi> in the <hi>Kidneys</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing larger than the reſt, into which the ſmaller Pipes do convey and empty themſelves as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>Ciſterns:</hi> and out of theſe again there are other ſmall conveyances to tranſmit and ſend it forth: there are alſo certain pervious <hi>Carun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> or <hi>glandulous</hi> ſubſtances, through which the <hi>Serum</hi> is ſtrained; and thus the water is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by percolation.</p>
               <p>The Veſſels bringing into the <hi>Reins</hi> are the <hi>emulgent Arteries;</hi> and theſe draw a <hi>Serum</hi> from the great Trunk of the <hi>Aorta Arteria,</hi> and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49201:72"/>import it into the <hi>Kidneys</hi> (the <hi>emulgent</hi> Veins from the <hi>Vena cava</hi> were thought by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents to be for the ſame purpoſe; but latter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries contradict it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</p>
               <p>They alſo receive from the <hi>lacteal</hi> Veins the thinner and more watry part of the <hi>Chyle,</hi> being an expedite and ſhorter way: hence it is the Urine is pale or whitiſh, when the <hi>Kidneys</hi> are not ſtrong enough to give this <hi>milkie</hi> humor the urinary digeſtion: or when drink is too plentifully poured in, and forcing through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its due time; therefore great Drinkers commonly piſs a pale water.</p>
               <p>There are alſo <hi>Nerves</hi> inſerted into the <hi>Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys</hi> from a branch of the ſixth pair, which alſo ſerves the <hi>Ventricle:</hi> hence it is, that the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is drawn into conſent, by loſs of appetite, nauſeating and vomiting, when the <hi>Kidneys</hi> are pained, as in a fit of the <hi>Stone</hi> it is manifeſt. By theſe <hi>Nerves</hi> the <hi>Kidneys</hi> do ſuffer not only a heavineſs, but ſometimes very acute <hi>pains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Veſſels carrying the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> out of the <hi>Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,</hi> are the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reters;</hi> one belonging to each <hi>Kidney:</hi> and they paſs from hence down by the Loyns, between the two Membranes of the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> and are inſerted into the <hi>Bladder,</hi> to convey the Urine thither.</p>
               <p>The length of theſe urinary ductures are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a ſpan; the cavity or hollow like a ſtraw; but capable of enlargement to the bigneſs of a <hi>finger,</hi> as by a <hi>ſtone</hi> coming down, though with extreme pain, by reaſon they are membranous
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49201:72"/>and nervous, exquiſitely ſenſible; and therefore upon any obſtruction are highly urged to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, eſpecially by a ſolid, ſharp or rugged body, as <hi>ſtone</hi> or <hi>gravel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereby you may underſtand the <hi>office</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> of theſe parts; that is, to drain the body from a ſuperfluous, <hi>ſaline</hi> and <hi>tartarous</hi> ſeroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and this ought daily and dully to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: but this <hi>ſeroſity</hi> is not all diſcharged this way by the <hi>Reins,</hi> but ſome paſſeth off by inſenſible <hi>Tranſpiration,</hi> and ſome by manifeſt <hi>Sweats,</hi> but the greateſt part by the <hi>Kidneys.</hi> And from hence it appears, that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> is partly an excrement of the firſt digeſtion, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>aquoſity</hi> drawn from the <hi>lacteal</hi> Juyce; and partly of the ſecond, in reſpect of the <hi>Serum ſanguinis</hi> exhauſted from the blood by the emulgent <hi>Arteries.</hi> And here you may obſerve, that by a certain digeſtion or elabora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Kidneys</hi> theſe <hi>ſeroſities</hi> are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted into <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> and then carries an <hi>Odor</hi> or ſcent with it, much different from what it was before: and the like we may obſerve in other creatures, that their urines have peculiar ſmells, which argues a <hi>digeſtive</hi> tranſmutation.</p>
               <p>But although Nature intends and endeavors this work conſtantly; yet there are many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualties and impediments to diſturb theſe parts, and fruſtrate in ſome meaſure the deſignment of Nature: the errors and failings herein we ſhall recite; but thoſe chiefly that are accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with, or produce pain we ſhall diſcourſe of with brevity.</p>

                  <hi>Cauſes</hi> introducing this diſtemper are, too frequent uſe of <hi>Wine,</hi> ſtrong <hi>Drinks</hi> and hot <hi>Spices,</hi> much <hi>Riding,</hi> lying on the <hi>Back,</hi> and ſoft <hi>Beds,</hi> or too frequent <hi>Venery:</hi> and for a correction of this diſtemper all theſe procurers
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49201:73"/>and aggravators are ſparingly to be uſed, and ſome of them to be avoided and forborn.</p>
               <p>But if this intemperate <hi>Heat</hi> depend upon any other diſeaſe ſeated there, diſturbing the office of the <hi>Kidneys,</hi> and raiſing a preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heat; then Remedies muſt be applied to that, as the nature thereof does require, which being removed, this heat will allay and ceaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Imbecillity</hi> and weakneſs does ſometimes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the <hi>Reins,</hi> and a decay in the performance of their office may be perceived; and if this be not the conſequent of ſome manifeſt diſeaſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitating and rendring them incapable, then you muſt know that</p>
               <p>There is a natural <hi>Robor</hi> and fortitude im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in every part by Nature, whereby they execute their functions with integrity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy: there is alſo an inequal <hi>diſtribution</hi> of this vigor and ſtrength, that ſome parts natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are ſtrong and durable in their ſtations; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are not ſo firmly radicated in their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but by time ſpontaneouſly fall off from their duties, and decay much ſooner than other parts of the body. Hence it is that ſome, though regularly living, complain of this part, others of that.</p>
               <p>There are alſo <hi>occaſions, accidents,</hi> and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manners of living, which we call <hi>Diaetetic</hi> cuſtoms; which as they are various, do vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly injure and decay this or that part of the body, and cauſe it to decline ſooner than the reſt. Imbecillity therefore of the <hi>Reins</hi> comes
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49201:74"/>under ſome of theſe notions, and hath its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from thence; which when ſuch a caſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, examination is to be made, to which of theſe the caſe belongs and is to be aſcribed.</p>
               <p>Now that which I call Imbecillity or a decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate, is when the <hi>Reins</hi> do not make a due ſecretion or ſeparation of the <hi>Serum</hi> from the blood, and give it the <hi>urinary</hi> tranſmutation: ſo that from hence the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> is but little, and that not well digeſted: the injurious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents whereof are many; for the blood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining too much diluted, and over-charged with the <hi>Serum</hi> or watry part; which being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed throughout the body, and falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this or that part, cauſe many <hi>Hydropic</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and ſome of them mortal: as examples hereof might be given.</p>
               <p>The next conſiderable is, <hi>Conſumptive</hi> waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, diminution, or leſſening of the <hi>Kidneys,</hi> not by ulceration, but exſiccation; proceeding from a hot and dry diſtemper of the <hi>Kidneys,</hi> arriving to a colliquating <hi>Hectic,</hi> or <hi>Tabes;</hi> which by time begets a Conſumption of the whole Body: procured ſometimes from a <hi>fala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> temperament.</p>
               <p>There is felt a heavineſs and weakneſs about the <hi>Loins,</hi> and the <hi>Kidneys</hi> do not perform their office aright.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inflammation</hi> ſometimes poſſeſſeth the <hi>Reins:</hi> cauſed by pain of the <hi>ſtone, gravel,</hi> or otherwiſe by <hi>obſtructions:</hi> ſometimes by a <hi>blow</hi> or <hi>fall;</hi> alſo by an influx of <hi>blood,</hi> or any foul corrupt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49201:74"/>
                  <hi>matter</hi> tranſmuted thither and lodged there, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the paſſages, and cauſing a ſuppreſſion of Urine.</p>
               <p>This diſeaſe is always accompanied with an acute <hi>Feaver,</hi> great <hi>Thirſt,</hi> aſtriction of the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> heat of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> and great pain about the <hi>Loins:</hi> and if the Arteries be affected, the pain will be with pulſation: Sometimes a <hi>Delirium</hi> attends, with long watching; and if the <hi>Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> be in the <hi>Membrane,</hi> the Patient is ſcarce able to ſit upright, becauſe the pain thereby is exaſperated.</p>
               <p>If the right <hi>Kidney</hi> be affected, pain extends upwards to the <hi>Liver</hi> and ſhort Ribs, and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the <hi>Genitals;</hi> alſo a <hi>ſtupor</hi> ſeizeth the right Thigh by conſent; the Nerve being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed that paſſeth thence down to the Thigh. But if the left <hi>Kidney</hi> be the part affected, that ſide is moſt grieved, and in like manner: but if both the <hi>Kidneys</hi> be attacked, then the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms on both ſides are equal.</p>
               <p>The termination of theſe Inflammations are either by an <hi>Apoſtem</hi> or <hi>Abſceſs;</hi> by induration and a <hi>ſcirrhous</hi> hardneſs; or by <hi>Tranſpiration</hi> and reſolution: which laſt is the only ſafe and ſecure way, and this the <hi>Phyſician</hi> ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for, and aim at in his adminiſtrations.</p>
               <p>But if contrary to his endeavors, the <hi>Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation apoſtemates, ſuppurates,</hi> and breaks, evacuating the purulent matter by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reters</hi> into the <hi>Bladder,</hi> there is good hopes of ſafety; but if it be diſcharged inwards by the <hi>emulgent</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:49201:75"/>Veins, the caſe is deſperate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scirrhous Tumors</hi> in the next place come to be viewed; and theſe are hard Tumors very difficult to be removed: being the relict of an <hi>Inflammation</hi> or other <hi>Tumor</hi> preceding, and not well cured: or formed by groſs matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted and accumulated there, cauſing contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>obſtructions:</hi> for humoral matter flowing thither, and being obſtructed in the tranſition, the heat of the part does exſiccate and harden it by time more and more; and then by accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and addition forms a <hi>Tumor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This cauſeth heavineſs about the Loins, but little pain: the Urine is but little alſo, and that pale and watry, in regard the office of the <hi>Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys</hi> is debilitated, and by reaſon of the anguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the paſſages, letting paſs the thinner, but retaining the thicker part of the Urine.</p>
               <p>The longer this <hi>Tumor</hi> continues, the more difficult and incurable it becomes; and withal, it brings on <hi>hydropic Cachexies:</hi> for the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous ſeroſity not being drained away, regurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates back into the body.</p>
               <p>The Cure is to be ſet upon with internal and external Medicines: <hi>Aperitives, Reſolvents, Diſcuſſives</hi> and <hi>Emollients.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apertion</hi> of the Veſſels, contrary to Nature, ſomtimes does threaten danger, by the appearance of <hi>blood</hi> ſtaining the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine:</hi> and this proceeds from a weakneſs of the Veſſels, being relaxed in their retentive faculty; or by a plenitude and fulneſs of blood; or becauſe the blood is thin
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49201:75"/>and ſharp, which cauſeth the mouths of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to open.</p>
               <p>On the contrary; <hi>Anguſtneſs</hi> or ſtraitneſs ſometimes does incommode the Veſſels apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the <hi>Reins,</hi> which hinders the free ranſmiſſion of the <hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now this anguſtneſs of the Veſſels does ariſe either by <hi>compreſſion</hi> from ſome <hi>Tumor,</hi> or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended part that preſſeth upon the Veſſels and ſtraitens them from without:</p>
               <p>Or by <hi>contraction</hi> or conſtriction of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels that are ſhrunk; as by great heat in long Feavers, or a <hi>Tabes</hi> that ſeizeth the <hi>Kidneys:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or laſtly, by <hi>obſtruction</hi> within from ſome viſcous matter, grumous or clotted <hi>blood, ſand, gravel, ſtone,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sign</hi> declaring theſe obſtructions, is a ſuppreſſion of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> with <hi>pain;</hi> or an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the uſual quantity, not anſwerable to the drink received. The place or part affected, whether in the <hi>Kidneys</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reters,</hi> is known by the ſeat of pain.</p>
               <p>The cauſes that obſtruct are known by their proper <hi>ſignals,</hi> and by examining into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding ſtate of the <hi>Patient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The place or part grieved with theſe obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, whether in the <hi>Kidneys</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reters,</hi> pain diſcovers, and the diſlodging or ſhifting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Of all the <hi>obſtructions</hi> that infeſt the <hi>Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,</hi> the moſt frequent and ſaddeſt complaint is from the <hi>Stone;</hi> this being the moſt contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49201:76"/>obſtruction, the moſt painful, being a hard ſolid body, and the moſt uncertain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies for relief.</p>
               <p>Concerning the generation of theſe Stones, there have been various Opinions amongſt Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men: in ſhort, the difference and conteſt hereupon may be reduced to theſe two Heads; what the <hi>material</hi> cauſe of the <hi>Stone</hi> is, and what the <hi>efficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>material</hi> cauſe, or matter whereof the <hi>Stone</hi> is bred; <hi>Galen</hi> and moſt of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will have it to be, a <hi>phlegmatic,</hi> groſs, or viſcous humor apt for condenſation and indura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and the <hi>efficient</hi> to be <hi>heat</hi> exſiccating this matter, and bringing it to a ſtony hardneſs; but others of them will have this to proceed from <hi>cold,</hi> by way of congelation.</p>
               <p>But this Doctrine cannot hold as rational, nor does it anſwer experience: as for the matter we cannot allow it to be ſuch; for as much as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that abound with a viſcous tough <hi>Phlegm</hi> and ſlimy matter, as moſt ancient people do, yet many of them are never trouble with ſtone or gravel. And for a concurrence of both the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, material and efficient, we have examples of the <hi>Aged,</hi> who are moſt cold and <hi>phlegmatic;</hi> and for abounding heat with the like matter, we may produce <hi>Feavers;</hi> yet no ſtony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion or ſigns thereof to be found from ſuch ſickneſſes: So that we are now to ſeek for other cauſes both <hi>material</hi> and <hi>efficient,</hi> whereon to ground our endeavors for the relief of ſuch as are afflicted with this diſeaſe.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:49201:76"/>
               <p>The matter therefore and ſubſtance of the Stone, is from a tartarous and ſaline <hi>ſuccus,</hi> with the addition of a terreſtrial feculency, concreted or petrified by a lapidifactory Spirit or diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Reins, which is the efficient and ſeminal being of that production.</p>
               <p>The concurrence of both theſe cauſes does much produce the <hi>Stone,</hi> and afflict the <hi>Patient</hi> in a high degree: but one of them is ſufficient, <hi>viz.</hi> this <hi>petrifying</hi> power of the <hi>Reins,</hi> to coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate any laudable good matter imported there, into a ſtony ſubſtance: To confirm this, <hi>Fernelius</hi> relates upon his own knowledge of one that for three or four months together, above a dozen ſmall <hi>ſtones</hi> came from him eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day; all which time notwithſtanding, he eat nothing but Broths and Panadoes, being confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his Bed by weakneſs and pain.</p>
               <p>But allowing this to be true from the credit of the <hi>Author;</hi> yet we muſt owne and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that beſides this principal cauſe of a <hi>petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Spirit</hi> in the <hi>Reins,</hi> there are alſo antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and <hi>procatarctic</hi> cauſes adjuvant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting; as ſome ſorts of meats and drinks, and other errours in the <hi>Diaetetics,</hi> that increaſe and ſet forward this diſeaſe, which otherwiſe might be much ſlower in generation, nor yet arrive to ſo high a degree of torture: alſo the <hi>Stomach, Spleen</hi> or <hi>Liver</hi> not performing their functions rightly, may contribute matter to the promotion hereof.</p>
               <p>For relief of the diſeaſed in this caſe, there
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49201:77"/>are two grand intentions to be proſecuted, and aimed at: a <hi>diſſolution</hi> of the body of the <hi>ſtone</hi> already generated; and ſecondly, the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the <hi>petrifying</hi> diſpoſition of the <hi>Reins,</hi> and abolition of that coagulating ferment: and for theſe purpoſes were <hi>Paracelſus</hi> his <hi>Ludus</hi> and <hi>Aroph;</hi> alſo the <hi>Alkaheſt</hi> cannot fail here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>But ſuch as have not acquired the great <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana's,</hi> and cannot procure a diſſolvent for the <hi>Stone,</hi> that is, to make an <hi>Analyſis</hi> or reſolution of it into a liquid juyce, and reduce it back again to its humoral flowing ſtate, capable of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſion and cleanſing out, muſt endeavor to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the excluſion of this hard body, by the beſt and moſt hopeful means for that purpoſe, by <hi>lubrifying, relaxing,</hi> and <hi>dilating</hi> the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and aſſwaging the <hi>Spaſm</hi> and contraction of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reters,</hi> that the <hi>ſtone</hi> may ſlide away much ſooner, and with leſs pain: hence by way of caution obſerve, That <hi>Diuretics</hi> and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers to expulſion are not to be given, before this preparation be made, elſe you precipitate the <hi>Patient</hi> into danger, and increaſe his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, diſlodging and forcing the ſtone through anguſt and very tender cavities, not provided to give paſſage without detriment to this unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſtranger.</p>
               <p>And thus much briefly concerning <hi>petrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or the production of <hi>Stones</hi> in the <hi>Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys;</hi> I proceed on to the next, a moſt difficu't and painful diſeaſe belonging to this Member, namely <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers.</hi>
               </p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers</hi> of the <hi>Kidneys</hi> are introduced ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways, or take their riſe from ſeveral cauſes.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Acrimony</hi> and ſharpneſs of humor paſſing this way, and continuing long, does <hi>excoriate;</hi> which not timely obſerved and remedied (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe pains at firſt are but ſmall) does corrode farther, eat into the fleſh, and plants an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The <hi>Kidneys</hi> are ulceratedſometimes from an <hi>Inflammation</hi> or other <hi>Apoſtem</hi> there, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to ſuppuration and breaking, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth the matter by Urine, or otherwiſe, but leaves a putrid <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer</hi> behind.</item>
                  <item>3. Sometimes from a clot of <hi>blood</hi> extravaſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or out of its place putrifying, does infect the part, <hi>tabifie</hi> and <hi>ulcerate;</hi> and not to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, leſt this be the conſequent.</item>
                  <item>4. Sometimes a <hi>Stone,</hi> being rough, angular or ſharp, frets or grates upon the parts, and makes a ſolution of continuity, which at firſt ſends forth a <hi>bloody</hi> Urine, afterwards <hi>purulent</hi> and begets an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer:</hi> and this laſt is the moſt frequent cauſe that generates <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers</hi> in the <hi>Kidneys.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Theſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers</hi> are diſcovered by <hi>pain</hi> about the Loins, a purulent <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcles</hi> or ſmall fleſhy rags, or ſtrings of concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted blood is brought forth with the Urine, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied commonly with heat in the Back, and ſometimes faint Sweats, which continuing, bring on a Conſumption and <hi>Hectic</hi> Feaver.</p>
               <p>Of theſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers</hi> ſome are more ſordid, foul and ſtinking, as the Urine does declare: others not ill ſcented, the <hi>Pus</hi> white, not viſcous, but clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and light.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:49201:78"/>
               <p>The difficulty of theſe Cures lyes here; for that the Urine which is acrid flowing always by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer,</hi> hinders the conſolidation of the part: beſides, the ſituation being remote, the virtue of a Medicine is much altered before it arrive to the part: but in the deſignment and managing of theſe Cures, the body muſt be well cleanſed, not with the common <hi>deleterious</hi> Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but <hi>balſamic</hi> Deterſives; and ſo kept with a proper <hi>Diaetetic</hi> regimen, as no impurity or ſharp humors diſturb or abate the power or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, which muſt be truly <hi>balſamic</hi> and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>The experience of theſe Ulcers I have had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, both many years ſince and lately. <hi rend="margQuotes">I remember in the year 1652. I cured an Ulcer of the <hi>Kidneys</hi> in a man about thirty years of age, living near <hi>Sheffield</hi> in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> who came to me four miles twice a week during his Cure; I being then for a while at <hi>Norton</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the edge of <hi>Darby-ſhire.</hi> His Urine was <hi>hot, ſharp,</hi> and <hi>ſtinking,</hi> with a great <hi>purulent</hi> ſediment; a great <hi>pain</hi> in his Back, with ſcorching heat, and often fluſhing faint <hi>Sweats</hi> all over his Body. Indeed I have wondered ſince how I did perform ſuch a difficult Cure then, having ſo little practical knowledge, I being but a Tyro in this Art, it being in the firſt year of my Practice, and newly graduated Batchellor in Phyſick: but Providence had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed me the inſtrument to free this poor man out of his pain and languiſhing condition.</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:49201:78"/>Since I have been acquainted with ſeveral of the like caſes, and may with better aſſurance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a Cure, from tryed Medicines acquired by experience, beyond what Book-practice does communicate: and this laſt year here in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> I cured a Gentlewoman of an Ulcer in the Kidneys.</p>
               <p>In the next place we are to take notice of <hi>Pains</hi> belonging to the <hi>Bladder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Bladder</hi> is the laſt receptacle for the Urine , and performs the office of a <hi>Ciſtern</hi> to the Body, for keeping and diſcharging the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine at convenient times; and therefore is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of diſtenſion and contraction, being a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous bag, furniſhed with right, tranſverſe, and oblique <hi>Fibres</hi> for that purpoſe: and hath two <hi>Muſcles</hi> at the neck of it, to let go or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Urine.</p>
               <p>This part is liable to great grievances and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful infirmities: as <hi>Diſtenſion, Obstructions, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, Excreſcences, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers, ſcirrhous</hi> hardneſs. From hence come <hi>ſuppreſſions</hi> of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, <hi>imminution</hi> or ſmall quantity, <hi>ardor</hi> or heat of Urine, <hi>Strangury</hi> or dolorous emiſſion and dropping, <hi>incontinency</hi> of Urine or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of retaining it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diſtenſion</hi> of the <hi>Bladder</hi> happens from too long retaining of the Urine, whether it be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary or involuntary: ſo that afterwards the <hi>Fibres</hi> do not recover again the power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the Bladder: and this may prove of dangerous conſequence, and to ſome it hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved mortal.</p>

                  <hi>Obſtructions</hi> of the <hi>Bladder,</hi> cauſing a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Urine, or diminution, dolorous or difficult excretion, does ariſe from many cauſes: as a <hi>ſtone</hi> in the Bladder or gravel, coagulated <hi>blood, worms,</hi> a viſcous <hi>humor</hi> or <hi>purulent</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a <hi>Caruncle</hi> or <hi>Tumor</hi> in the neck of the Bladder: or by <hi>compreſſion</hi> from a tumified part adjacent; as the <hi>Womb</hi> or right Inteſtine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inflammation</hi> ſometimes happens from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of pain by the <hi>Stone, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer,</hi> or other torturing cauſe; and theſe <hi>Inflammations</hi> are commonly mortal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vlcers</hi> do poſſeſs the Bladder ſometimes, and moſt commonly in the neck thereof, cauſed by a <hi>ſtone</hi> or gravel excoriating and wounding the part: or by an <hi>eroding</hi> purulent matter coming from other parts, and lodged there; or by a continued <hi>Acrimony</hi> and ſharpneſs of Urine corroding: ſometimes from an <hi>Inflammation</hi> or <hi>Abſceſs:</hi> more rarely, but it hath happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſometimes, from a <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> ill cured; and I may ſay very ill indeed; for the Ulcer thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, is of far greater difficulty and danger than the <hi>Gonorrhoea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not long ſince an Ulcer of the Bladder was committed to my care, being the relict of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhoea ill managed by a <hi>Chirurgeon,</hi> uſing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringents unſeaſonably.</p>
               <p>Ulcers in the <hi>meatus Penis,</hi> as alſo in the <hi>Proſtates,</hi> are more frequently offered to our help: as lately another perſon applying to me having an Ulcer procured in the <hi>Proſtates,</hi> from the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49201:79"/>like improper and pernicious courſe: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Gonorrhoea's</hi> are frequently cured, and may with much certainty and ſafety in skilful hands; yet there are many that patch up a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cure for the preſent, but future conſequents are ſad <hi>memento's</hi> of their Undertakers folly. And at this time I have a Patient, repenting that ever he committed himſelf into the hands of a practiſing <hi>Apothecary;</hi> for he by ſtopping his <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> before the <hi>virulency</hi> was eradicated (which I judge was done by aſtringent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines) the <hi>Patient</hi> was forced to leave his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker, and came to me in a painful and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous condition; one of the <hi>Teſticles</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, hard, and <hi>ſwell'd</hi> as big as a Turky<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egg.</p>
               <p>By ſuch miſcarriages ſome have been quite loſt; others have been perplexed and almoſt ruined afterwards with difficult and very chargeable Cures: as not long ago, a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> came to me, who had ſpent above five hundred pounds, having been under ſeveral <hi>Phyſicians</hi> and <hi>Chirurgeons</hi> of good repute, for ſome years; being reduced to ſuch a difficult ſtate, from the imprudence of his firſt Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker.</p>

               <p>Concerning the continent cauſe of the Gout, there are various Opinions; ſome determine it a ſanguine humor, others phlegmatic; ſome a choleric, others melancholy, and ſome a mixture of theſe humors. <hi>Hippoc. lib.</hi>

               <p>Thus from the difference of opinions and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes concerning the <hi>Gout,</hi> the deſignment of Cure, and means adapted thereto have been va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49201:82"/>and alſo fraſtraneous: other improbable opinions there are, but I wave the recital? of them, and come to ſet down what is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant with reaſon, eſtabliſhed upon latter and clearer diſcoveries.</p>
               <p>And here I muſt premiſe a few things as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory, but neceſſarily ſerving to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Food</hi> which ſuſtains and repairs the body is meat and drink; of meats ſome are liquid, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſolid: but the ſolid and dryer meats co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the ſtomach, are macerated, liquefied and tranſmuted (by the digeſtive power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and aſſiſtance of ingeſted liquors)is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into a liquid juyce called <hi>Chyle:</hi> this Chyle being exported out of the ſtomach, receives ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral alterations afterwards in the various parts through which it paſſeth, and is become a milky juyce in the <hi>Venae lacteae,</hi> blood in the <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries,</hi> water in the <hi>Lymphae-ductus,</hi> and a ſpirituous exalted <hi>Succus</hi> in the <hi>Nerves;</hi> and all theſe for various uſes and purpoſes; but ſtill keeping in a liquid form, and flowing in the Veſſels containing. And to prevent ſtagnation or ſtoppage of their motion in the ſeveral ſmall Pipes of conveyance through the body; hence it is that all the humors or juyces of the body, do participate much of <hi>water,</hi> or a thin watry and fluctuating ſubſtance called <hi>Serum,</hi> by ſome <hi>Lympha,</hi> by <hi>Helmont Latex:</hi> which being thus appointed for a diſtribution of the <hi>Chyle</hi> and <hi>Blood;</hi> hence it is that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> fitly calls it
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49201:83"/>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Vehiculum nutrimenti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Seroſity</hi> or watry part abounding, is not eaſily contained in the Veſſels or Conduit-pipes, eſpecially being depraved, become ſharp and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating with a <hi>Tartarous</hi> ſaltneſs; but either by <hi>apertion</hi> or <hi>exſudation</hi> is let put; and where it takes its courſe, diſcharging it ſelf upon ſome tender part, there pain and trouble ariſeth.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Gout</hi> takes its beginning from an acrid or ſharp <hi>ſaline ſeroſity,</hi> invading the <hi>Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Membranes</hi> and <hi>nervous</hi> parts about the Joynts, lancinating thoſe tender and very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts.</p>
               <p>But how this <hi>Serum</hi> comes to abound, and how to be depraved, is worth our inquiry; for from hence is the deſignment of Cure grounded, to prevent and take off both the one and the other. So long as it remains in its due ſtate for quantity and quality, it is very neceſſary and uſeful to the body; but when it degenerates or is redundant, it raiſeth diſturbance variouſly, according to the parts it does infeſt: hence <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhs</hi> or deſtillation of <hi>Rheums</hi> into the <hi>Eyes,</hi> cauſing them to be ſore, hot and inflamed; ſometimes upon the <hi>Lungs,</hi> cauſing vehement <hi>Coughs</hi> and ſhortneſs of breath: from hence <hi>pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,</hi> ſtitches or ſharp pricking pains in divers parts of the body; <hi>Head-aches, Tooth-aches,</hi> ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Pleuriſies, Rheumatiſms, Arthritic</hi> or Gout-pains.</p>
               <p>Now this ſeroſity does abound, either from a deficiency of the digeſtions, and tranſmutation
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49201:83"/>of alimentary matter received: or from a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of ſecretion or, diſcharge of it by thoſe <hi>Emunctories</hi> appointed for that purpoſe; for as there is a continual ſupply by eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo there ought; to be a proportionable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> From a defect of digeſtion in the <hi>Chyle</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> when they do not attain that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſtate as Nature hath required; but receive only a crude and imperfect tranſmutation: and this ſometimes procured from an injurious ſort of meats and drinks, or offending in quantity; as much <hi>Fruits,</hi> ſmall <hi>Beer, Water,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> From an inſufficient diſcharge, and for want of due evacuation, this <hi>Serum</hi> does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound and become ſuperfluous: that is, when the parts deſtined by Nature to ſeparate, attract and tranſmit this ſeroſity of the <hi>Chyle</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> do not perform their office duly; as when the <hi>Lymphaeducts, Spleen</hi> or <hi>Reins</hi> are deficient in their functions; alſo when the <hi>Pores</hi> are occlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and Tranſpiration hindred, theſe occaſion the overflowing and abounding of this <hi>ſeroſity,</hi> having not its right conveyance, due vent, and diſcharge.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Latex</hi> or <hi>Serum</hi> rarely continues in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary ſtate of redundance, but alſo is then ſoon vitiated and becomes depraved: for as our meats and drinks are endowed with a <hi>Tartarous</hi> and ſaline principle; ſo this <hi>Serum</hi> is impregnated therewith, and abounding variouſly as the food received contains variety of Salts; which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49201:84"/>themſelves and appear more or leſs, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſtrength or debility of the digeſtive power of fermentation, being able to ſubdue and ſubject them to the ſervice of the body; or otherwiſe to ſuffer them to be exalted in their peculiar natures: and then as they are more ſharp or milder, ſo is the pain and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance from them greater or leſs.</p>
               <p>But how this <hi>ſaline ſeroſity</hi> does diſcharge it ſelf upon the Joynts, and affect them with pain, is (by the conſent of Authors) from a laxity or imbecillity of articulation, or promptneſs of the Joynts to receive: but this reaſon I cannot cloſe with, ſince a more probable and rational may be given, which is from the formation and conformation of parts, as thus: That when the <hi>Serum ſanguinis</hi> this ſeroſity does <hi>efferveſcere</hi> and <hi>ebullire,</hi> eſtuate and grow turgid in the great Veſſels of the Veins and Arteries, afterwards in the ſmaller Veſſels; then it comes into their branches, and ſo to the extremities and termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them; which terminations (moſt of them) are placed in the Joynts, where they do <hi>effundere,</hi> diſcharge and let out this hoſtile inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Serum,</hi> and therewith torment the Joynts, cauſing ſharp lancinating <hi>Pains, Inflammation</hi> and <hi>Tumor</hi> of the part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuch Symptoms as attend the <hi>Gout.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the <hi>Gout</hi> makes its progreſs from one ſtate to another; ſo the Symptoms ſupervening do vary and appear gradually, as the diſeaſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives to its height and fierceneſs. <hi>First,</hi> the part
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49201:84"/>affected is more tender and ſenſible than uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, alſo leſs active and vigorous in motion: and before a fit of the <hi>Gout</hi> oftentimes a general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition or <hi>febrile</hi> heat diſturbs the Patient; the blood then fermenting for a purification, caſts off this <hi>morbific tartarous ſeroſity</hi> upon the Joynts. The part thus affected moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is <hi>tumefied,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>inflamed,</hi> pains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and grow very ſharp, and in ſome by time and continuance of this diſeaſe a <hi>tophous</hi> hardneſs or <hi>Nodes</hi> ſeize the part as the relicts and inſignal characters thereof.</p>
               <p>Some have the Symptoms of the <hi>Gout</hi> in a remiſs degree, only at changes of the weather and ſeaſons of the year, and are not confined to the houſe by a conſiderable ſeiſure and great pain, but can walk abroad, although with ſome complaints and indiſpoſition: others are attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more violently, and ſo diſabled, that they are laid up and deprived of their liberty.</p>
               <p>To ſome the <hi>Gout</hi> is hereditary, derived from their parents in the principles of their Nature, and will ſhew it ſelf, although they be of a ſtrict and regular life: to others it is adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, ariſing from the procuring cauſes of this diſeaſe in the courſe of their life; by intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and inordinate, or incongruous way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the <hi>Diaetetics,</hi> unſuitable and unfit for their condition of body.</p>
               <p>For Cure of this Diſeaſe, theſe aims, are to be intended and proſecuted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That this <hi>ſaline</hi> acid humor be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49201:85"/>and ſtopt in the fountain or ſpring, the parts mandant from whence it does ariſe, that a future ſupply may not be generated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is already produced, may be mortified, abſterſed and evacuated out of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the parts recipient, invaded and debilitated, may be eaſed, reſtored and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated.</p>
               <p>The firſt intention is performed by ſuch means as <hi>rectifie</hi> and <hi>fortifie</hi> the digeſtions, whereby their elaborations and tranſmutations of aliment received may be pure in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per natures and free from any degenerate mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and here both good Aliment and good Medicament is required: for election of meats and drinks, and other Diaetetic rules neceſſary for gouty perſons to obſerve, conſult that Book called, <hi>The Preſervation of Health,</hi> &amp;c. where at large you are adviſed, and too much to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert here. For Medicament, gentle <hi>Vomits</hi> are profitable, both for cleanſing and removing of the fundamental matter; as alſo for a revulſion from the part affected, and retarding the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thither: but where that operation is not convenient, then keep the ſtomach clean with a good <hi>Purgative</hi> downwards: the beſt Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medicines for this purpoſe is <hi>Pil. ſtomac.</hi> and <hi>Aloephangin.</hi> alſo <hi>Syr. de ſpina cervin.</hi> and <hi>Elixir propriet.</hi> in the intervals.</p>
               <p>The ſecond deſignment, is attained by <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes,</hi> whoſe properties are to correct and kill all
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49201:85"/>acidities and corroſive ſharpneſs: and theſe are the Salts of Vegetables made by Calcination: and next to theſe are Abſorbents that imbibe and tame acids, being alkaliſate or affine to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies:</hi> as <hi>Oculi cancror. Coral. Chelae canc. cran. human, corn. cer. uſt. margarit. ſacchar. Saturni. &amp;c.</hi> But beſides theſe, <hi>Cathartics, Diaphoretics,</hi> and <hi>Diuretics</hi> are to be uſed in due order; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the tartarous matter reſiding or fluctuating in any part of the body may be ſent forth ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways.</p>
               <p>To perform the work of Purgation you may uſe <hi>Arcanum corallinum</hi> and <hi>Pilulae Antimoniales</hi> prepared to work only downwards, which are of the better ſort of Medicines made publick: in my own Practice I uſe <hi>Pil. Arthriticae noſtr.</hi> which ſeldom fail my expectation; being ſeconded by ſome other Medicines in their due place.</p>
               <p>After Purgation promote <hi>Tranſpiration,</hi> for this does much abate and ſcatter the ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>ſeroſity,</hi> driving it <hi>à centro ad circumferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi> and tranſmitting it by the Pores; and may be done with ♁ <hi>diaphoret.</hi> or with <hi>decoct. rad. bardan. ſaſſaphras, chinae, ſarſaparillae, card. benedict.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo Evacuation by Urine is of great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to ſpend and drain the acrid <hi>Serum</hi> that way: and to ſet forward this operation, uſe <hi>Sal ſuccin.</hi> or the Mercurial liquor that ſeparates from the Oil and Salt after diſtillation: alſo <hi>Sal volat. urinae &amp; viper.</hi> are profitable.</p>
               <p>To effect the third intention? <hi>Topical</hi> Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49201:86"/>to aſſwage pain, to diſcuſs and roborate, are uſeful and neceſſary to relieve the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
               <p>For allaying pain in time of extremity, this <hi>Anodyne</hi> Cataplaſm hath been uſed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for ſucceſsful: <hi>Rad. lilior. alb. althaeae a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> ℥<hi>ii. fol. parietar. hyoſcyam. ana M. j.

               <p>But they that will take a little pains to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a good Medicine, let them unite <hi>Sal volat. urinae cum ſpir. vin. rectificat.</hi> by digeſtion and circulation, in which if you diſſolve a little <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire,</hi> you have then an excellent Topic Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy both curative and prophylactic, with which you are to foment the part every day.</p>
               <p>Or if you will make a Cataplaſm <hi>cum mica panis alb.</hi> macerated <hi>in ſpir. vin. addend. croci pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> you have then a ſafe and good Medicine.</p>
               <p>Some do adventure to uſe Reſtringents, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers and Coolers, to drive back the humor flowing; and they are made of <hi>Bol. armen. ſang.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49201:86"/>dracon. malicor. album. ovor. acetum,</hi> and ſuch like; but this is hazardous and dangerous to give the morbific humor a ſudden check, which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn upon ſome noble part; therefore I adviſe againſt ſuch attempts, being not rational, and experience hath confirmed their fetal events.</p>
               <p>For a <hi>Prophylactic</hi>-Remedy, or by way of prevention, to keep off the returns of the Gout, <hi>Spigelius</hi> commends this Medicine, and calls it his Podagrical Antidote.</p>

               <p>Of the Powder he appoints a ſcruple for a Doſe, of the <hi>Electuary</hi> a dram; and a draught of warm water to be drunk after it. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine is good; but warm water to be taken after, I cannot ſo well comply with that. For my own Patients, I give an Extract deſigned for this purpoſe, and ſometimes a Diet-drink, which ſtrengthens the digeſtions, and prevents the <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line ſeroſity</hi> from generation, and are preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of value to thoſe that have experienced them.</p>
               <p>Now as concerning the <hi>curability</hi> and <hi>incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of the <hi>Gout,</hi> we will make ſome inquiriy into this matter, becauſe 'tis acknowledged by all to be of difficult Cure; and by many 'tis ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49201:87"/>an incurable diſeaſe: this opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fixed in the minds of moſt people ſo afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and deſpairing of help, at leaſt of a Cure, they provide only to abide the <hi>pain,</hi> and reſolve to be contented with their condition, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is no other remedy but <hi>patience,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee few or none cured.</p>
               <p>But I cannot conſent with this opinion, that the <hi>Gout</hi> is an incurable diſeaſe, knowing the contrary by experience; although I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, ſuch Cures are rarely performed: and the reaſon why; not ſo much from the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the thing to be done, as from the <hi>intra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctability</hi> of the perſons to be governed and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the circumſtances under which ſome perſons lye.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>younger</hi> ſort being the moſt curable, or in the beſt capacity for it; they will not be confined to ſuch Methods, Rules, and abſtinence for ſuch a time as is requiſite for this Cure; but indulge themſelves in the liberty of their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and pleaſures of ſenſe, doing thoſe things which are very oppoſite and injurious to their condition of body; whereby they ſet on and procure the returns of this diſeaſe, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſome former good means uſed, hath taken good effect, and checkt the obſtinacy of this <hi>Malady</hi> with hopes of prevailing.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>old</hi> and feeble ſort, they have not that aſſiſtance of Nature to cooperate with the means; beſides, the continuance and long im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of this diſeaſe, habitually indiſpoſing,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49201:87"/>perverting, and enfeebling the parts affected, both <hi>mandant</hi> and <hi>recipient;</hi> which makes the perfect reſtauration of ſuch, of much greater difficulty, and very rarely effected.</p>
               <p>To theſe we may add, that for the moſt part, the <hi>Gout</hi> takes up its quarters with the rich and thoſe that live plentifully, having all things for pleaſure, eaſe and delight.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, and more at large might be amplified; how the <hi>Gout</hi> becomes ſo triumphant and invincible, having gained the character of <hi>Opprobrium Medicorum,</hi> as able to baffle all the deſigns of Phyſicians and their Remedies.</p>
               <p>But amongſt the vain Opinions that are raiſed
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49201:88"/>concerning the <hi>Gout;</hi> this is not the leaſt that alienates the minds of moſt people from their reaſon, and checks their endeavors for help: <hi>viz.</hi> that it is dangerous to tamper or provoke this <hi>Lion,</hi> becauſe ſome have miſcarried, and died by trying with uncertain means and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous Medicines; who otherwiſe probably might have lived a long time, the diſeaſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly not being mortal, but a lingering and torturing ſickneſs. And farther, it was related to me, that a great perſon in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> a few years ſince (now dead) being often and much afflicted with the <hi>Gout,</hi> his <hi>Phyſicians</hi> told him, that the <hi>Gout</hi> kept him alive; and if he were cured thereof, he would dye ſoon after.</p>
               <p>To obviate theſe objections I anſwer, and part hereof I grant, that ſome have dyed by their endeavours for Cure; and this not ſo ſtrange, for the like may be ſaid in all other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, that ſome have dyed by their <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> or ſuch as they intruſted as <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> and not ſolely or chiefly by their diſeaſe: Examples we have had in the moſt, if not all diſeaſes, the moſt curable and facile to be dealt with: ſo that by unskilful men, improper courſes or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignments, and by bad Medicines, or caſualties happening by the <hi>Patients</hi> folly or their Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, many have dyed in the prime and ſtrength of their age, by endeavoring for Cure in Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes not mortal nor of ſudden danger in their own Nature, and amongſt thoſe the <hi>Gout</hi> may be reckoned: So that if you will plead for no
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49201:88"/>Phyſick, no <hi>tampering</hi> (as you call it) with the <hi>Gout,</hi> by the ſame argument you may abandon Phyſick in all other ſickneſſes; for the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is equal, and the ſecurity depends only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the judgment and ability of the Phyſician, and no more hazard in this diſeaſe than in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I ſay therefore, in caſe of the <hi>Gout,</hi> as alſo in all other diſeaſes, if you will ſecurely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; take a knowing man well grounded in the Theory, and through paced in the Practice of this <hi>Art;</hi> Having a frequent experience in the progreſs and Cure of Diſeaſes, and a critical Obſervator of the <hi>Gout</hi> in particular; this man you may as freely truſt, and ſafely yield obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to in managing a Cure for the <hi>Gout,</hi> as you can do to other <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> in all caſes whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
               <p>Now as for thoſe <hi>Phyſicians</hi> (if there be any ſuch ſo ignorant or fallacious) that alledge the <hi>Gout</hi> to be any way a Preſervative of Life, and pretend not to cure it for that cauſe, I muſt tell them plainly; <hi>first,</hi> that this is only a <hi>pretence</hi> to palliate their inability, and a crafty evaſion to ſhift off the cenſure that may fall upon them, for not curing what they ought, and would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly do if they could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To ſhew the pretence is errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and void of truth; we will ſearch the <hi>Gout</hi> and ſee if there be any thing in it, or appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, that is a Preſervative of mans life, or conducing to his health and a ſound ſtate of being.</p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:49201:89"/>
               <p>In the <hi>Gout</hi> there is no pleaſure nor recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either of <hi>Mind</hi> or <hi>Body;</hi> both which are promoters of <hi>Health,</hi> and conſequently prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of <hi>Life:</hi> but on the contrary, the <hi>Gout</hi> is attended with a ſedentary inactive confinement, melancholy, pain, watching, and unſeaſonable ſleep, (the conſequents and effects of which are debility ot all the faculties and enervation of ſtrength) which as theſe continue longer or more violent, and return more frequently and often, by ſo much more is the <hi>Patient</hi> damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, both for the preſent and the future, and rendred more infirm and liable to the decays of Nature.</p>
               <p>But perhaps you will ſay, this <hi>ſeroſity</hi> and ſharp punging humor, falling into an ignoble part, and far off from the <hi>Vitals,</hi> is much better and ſafer there than to wander up and down the body which (as it hath happened ſometimes) may invade a principal part, and there threaten or cauſe death: therefore ſo long as this humor hath a recourſe to the <hi>Joynts,</hi> and is not turned off from that current, the <hi>Patient</hi> is not in ſuch great danger as otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>To this I reply, That true it is, if there were a neceſſity that this <hi>Tartarous</hi> gouty humor muſt invade one part or other; better it is that it paſſeth a ſafer way, and lodgeth in an ignoble and remote part; and better it is that the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician</hi> does nothing than do hurt, or run a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous courſe. If he cannot <hi>eradicate</hi> this morbific matter, ſtop the ſpring and fountain
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49201:89"/>from whence it does ariſe, and where it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated: or this being too hard and difficult a work, if he cannot derive the ſtream and iſſue thereof to the vents and outlets that Nature hath appointed and framed for a diſcharge of ſuperfluous and degenerate humors, but lets them have their courſe (becauſe not mortal) to the conſtant trouble and damage of this or that part in particular, and conſequently makes the whole to ſuffer <hi>ſympathically</hi> and by conſent: ſuch a <hi>Phyſician</hi> either hath not a true notion of this diſeaſe the <hi>Gout,</hi> or elſe he wants commanding Medicines elaborated by his own hands, exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and effectual to anſwer the indications that this diſeaſe and cauſes thereof will put him upon for relief of the <hi>Patient:</hi> but to pretend that this diſeaſe muſt not be cured, becauſe it ſpends or employs the humor in a ſafe way (ſo called) is much what alike (but very unlike a good <hi>Phyſician</hi>) as to ſuffer a man to continue lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing in a Looſneſs or Vomiting, becauſe it diſchargeth ſome peccant ſtimulating matter: but in this caſe, as alſo in that of the <hi>Gout,</hi> the extravagancy and irritation of noxious humors are to be checkt, collected and ſent forth by good Medicines, in a placid gentle way, through convenient ductures and outlets, and not let to continue in a detrimental <hi>extravagant</hi> courſe.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the <hi>curability</hi> and <hi>incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of the <hi>Gout,</hi> I do owne that ſome are much more capable of Cure than others, by the nature and condition of their bodies: and ſome
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49201:90"/>are not curable, as age and other cirumſtances have reduced them to an incurable ſtate: yet I ſay, in the worſt of caſes there are <hi>mitigations</hi> and helps, that check and tame the fierceneſs of the diſeaſe, render it more tolerable and eaſie: and ſuch <hi>Prophylactics</hi> or Preventives there are (with a due Regimen of life) that will keep off the frequency, and retard the returns of this painful Malady.</p>
               <p>Thus much concerning the <hi>Gout</hi> fixed, or conſtant to a part: it remains that I deliver my thoughts and experience touching the <hi>Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> or running Gout, ſo called; becauſe it ſhifts from part to part, invading not only the Joynts, but alſo the <hi>membranoſum Genus,</hi> the Membranes both of the Muſcles, <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and Bones.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that ſometimes theſe pains are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal in the <hi>Muſcles</hi> and habit of the Body: ſometimes internal, when the <hi>Viſcera</hi> are aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as the <hi>Lungs, Liver, Inteſtines, Spleen,</hi> &amp;c. ſometimes theſe pains affect the <hi>Bones,</hi> by pricking the <hi>Perioſteum,</hi> that Membrane which covers and enwraps the bone.</p>
               <p>Some complain of their <hi>Arms,</hi> others of their <hi>Shoulder</hi>-blades; ſome the <hi>Bach,</hi> others or at other times the <hi>Breaſt;</hi> ſometimes the <hi>Thighs,</hi> and ſometimes the <hi>Legs;</hi> the humor ſhifting and moving from one place to another: and this upon changes of the weather, turning of the wind, and ſeaſons of the year; theſe pains do go and come, afflicting more or leſs: and yet
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49201:90"/>no ſwelling, <hi>Inflammation,</hi> or outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance upon the part grieved.</p>
               <p>Theſe pains continuing, or frequently infeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, do debilitate and diſable the parts affected; inſomuch that ſome go very weakly, others uſe their arms but with little ſtrength, and ſome the uſe of their <hi>Limbs</hi> almoſt taken away.</p>
               <p>The material and continent cauſe of theſe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive and vagrant <hi>pains,</hi> is the ſame or of the ſame nature with the former <hi>Arthritis</hi> or Joynt-Gout: <hi>viz.</hi> a tartarous or ſharp pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating <hi>ſeroſity</hi> that moleſts theſe ſeveral parts: and to confirm that this is a <hi>ſerous</hi> or watry hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; it makes no Tumor, nor ſuppurates, which were it of another kind it would: beſides, the mobility and fluctuating nature thereof, argues it to be of that kind: and farther <hi>à juvantibus</hi> we may moſt rationally conclude ſo; Tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and copious emiſſion of Urine, and alſo Purgation that evacuates <hi>ſerous</hi> humors, gives allay and ſedation to theſe fleeting pains.</p>
               <p>But why this ſhould be ſo moveable, and changing its place, the other fixed or conſtant to a part, ſince one and the ſame humoral mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the cauſe of both; the reaſon hereof may be this: from abundance of the humor, and for want of vent; one way not being ſufficient to receive and ſpend it, Nature is neceſſitated to find out and break through ſeveral ways; that is, by forcing the <hi>Anaſtomoſes,</hi> and opening the <hi>terminations</hi> of the Veins, ſpewing forth this <hi>punging</hi> irritating humor into ſeveral parts: and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49201:91"/>being an unwelcome gueſt, hoſtile and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, the <hi>Archaeus</hi> or <hi>vital</hi> principle defending its Territories <hi>(quoad poſſe)</hi> and unwilling to give it harbour, tranſmits it from place to place.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Rheumatiſm</hi> and erratic pains depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſame humoral cauſe with the <hi>Gout,</hi> will require much what the ſame method and Medicines for Cure: as alſo ſuch <hi>Prophylactics</hi> that are proper and fit by way of prevention for the other, may here be uſed with the like advantage; and therefore it is not needful to point out a particular <hi>methodus medendi,</hi> or peculiar Medicines: only the <hi>Topical</hi> Medicines are not of ſuch uſe here as in the Joynt-<hi>Gout.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I have gone through and briefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into the moſt, and moſt conſiderable pains incident to ſeveral and principal parts of mans <hi>Body:</hi> it remains now (as is propoſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the front of this Work) that I proceed on to the next Stage; <hi>viz.

               <p>The word <hi>Inflammatio</hi> uſed in the Latine, in the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>uro,</hi> to burn or inflame: in both Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages ſignifying ſome extraordinary and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural heat kindled and begun in ſome part of the Body: and in the common acceptation of a <hi>Phlegmon</hi> or <hi>Inflammation,</hi> is underſtood thereby a hot <hi>Tumor</hi> ariſing from blood.</p>
               <p>But although <hi>Inflammations</hi> are reckoned among the Tumors, and ſo accounted by moſt Practiſers: yet I muſt take leave to divide <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations</hi> from <hi>Tumors,</hi> and diſtinguiſh them apart, as properly ſo; for commonly they are ſeparate, although oftentimes conjunct: and the denomination was given <hi>à calore,</hi> not <hi>à tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Inflammation</hi> therefore I underſtand here only a preternatural or extraordinary heat begun in any part, (as the <hi>Etymon</hi> of the word imports) before a <hi>Tumor</hi> be raiſed; but by time
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49201:92"/>and continuance <hi>Inflammation</hi> or great heat does attract matter and forms a <hi>Tumor,</hi> and then <hi>Inflammation</hi> and <hi>Tumor</hi> are coupled or complicated together: for as we plainly find external parts to burn or feel very hot, and to look red; you ſay then, the part is inflamed, although no Tumor or ſwelling appear; ſo is it internally, the part is fiery, hot or inflamed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a fluxion of <hi>blood</hi> arrive thither to throng the part and raiſe a <hi>Tumor;</hi> ſo that there are <hi>Inflammations</hi> without <hi>Tumors,</hi> and <hi>Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi> conjoyned with <hi>Tumors;</hi> and here I make <hi>Inflammation</hi> a diſtinct Claſſis, and to be a gradation or ſtep towards a <hi>Tumor,</hi> which probably may follow, if not prevented, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it doth.</p>
               <p>And here it is worth our inquiry, to know the reaſons why ſome <hi>Inflammations</hi> produce <hi>Tumors,</hi> and ſome go off without forming a <hi>Tumor:</hi> and this is cauſed from the difference of the parts affected; and the copious <hi>influx,</hi> and contumacy of the <hi>material</hi> cauſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; from the efficacy of <hi>means</hi> timely uſed, or the ſtrength of <hi>Nature</hi> to relieve her ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are to take notice what parts of the Body are ſubject to <hi>Inflammations;</hi> and they are the <hi>muſcular</hi> fleſh, the <hi>Membranes,</hi> the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and the <hi>Glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's:</hi> hence it is, that <hi>Inflammations</hi> as they are ſeated in divers parts of the Body, ſo are they called by diſtinguiſhing names, from the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: as <hi>Phrenitis,</hi> an inflammation of the

               </list>
               <p>Now from the part affected you are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that any member the more <hi>nervous</hi> it is, by ſo much the <hi>pain</hi> is greater; and by how much the part is more <hi>fleſhy,</hi> by ſo much the ſooner the <hi>Inflammation</hi> comes to a reſolution, or collection of matter.</p>
               <p>In the third place we come to remark the <hi>conjunct</hi> and material cauſes of <hi>Inflammations:</hi> and they are generated either by <hi>obſtruction,</hi> or <hi>extravaſation:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſtruction</hi> begets <hi>Inflammation</hi> when the fluid liquors in the Veſſels are denied their free motion and tranſition: and this happens when theſe Juyces are coagulated, groſs or thick, and thereby become <hi>ſtagnant</hi> in the ſmaller Veſſels. Or by <hi>compreſſion,</hi> when the Veſſels are ſtopt by ſome adjacent part <hi>tumified</hi> or extended beyond its common bounds. Or by an <hi>influx</hi> of blood ruſhing into ſome ſmaller Veſſels, from whence there is not a ready tranſmiſſion and paſſage: for the <hi>venal</hi> and <hi>arterial</hi> Pipes entring into a member are commonly large, but grow ſmaller, as they go deeper in, and their ramifications very minute, that they may ſoon be overchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by a turgid blood, more than ordinarily fermenting and flowing in.</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:49201:93"/>
               <p>Thus great <hi>pain</hi> from what cauſe ſoever may introduce <hi>Inflammation,</hi> by drawing a flux of humors to a part or member, from whence they cannot readily retire or move forwards. And here you may ſee how <hi>Contuſions, Luxations, Fractures,</hi> &amp;c. do occaſion <hi>Inflammations,</hi> if not prevented by care and skill with exquiſite good means.</p>
               <p>By <hi>extravaſation</hi> ſometimes <hi>Inflammations</hi> do ariſe; that is, when either by plenitude and fulneſs, or heat and thinneſs of blood, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations or mouths of the Veins are opened, and ſome effuſion made; which then being out of its proper place does degenerate and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and affords matter for <hi>Inflammation.</hi> Thus by <hi>Ruptures, Punctures</hi> and <hi>Wounds,</hi> extravaſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>blood</hi> is the material cauſe of <hi>Inflammations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly;</hi> but matter alone cannot produce an <hi>Inflammation</hi> (nor any other diſeaſe) being inactive and a dead thing of it ſelf, except ſome vital Agent works upon it, forms and moves it: who or what this Agent is, we are to inquire farther.</p>
               <p>Since then <hi>Inflammation</hi> is not procured by <hi>matter</hi> alone, nor can it exiſt only by <hi>matter,</hi> there muſt then be an internal <hi>efficient</hi> and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Principle joyned with this <hi>matter,</hi> that fabricates and generates of this matter an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But underſtand me rightly: I do not mean that this matter takes fire and is kindled, as if it were a <hi>ſulphurous</hi> and combuſtible matter, and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49201:93"/>ſo cauſe an <hi>Inflammation</hi> or ſcorching heat, no ſuch thing: but this <hi>morbific</hi> hoſtile matter ſtirs up the vital heat by way of irritation, provokes the vital principle to eſtuate and wax hot: for from hence does all heat <hi>emanare,</hi> ſtream, and iſſue forth; whether it be a temperate and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural warmth, or a preternatural and inflaming heat, both proceed from this fountain: So that hereby you muſt diſtinguiſh between the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional matter of <hi>Inflammations,</hi> and the internal efficient that does <hi>excandeſcere &amp; inflammare.</hi> This inflaming heat ariſeth from a principle much different from the <hi>materia morbifica occaſionalis:</hi> this great heat does not riſe out of the morbific <hi>matter</hi> inflamed, but from the vital <hi>Principle</hi> incenſed.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Stone</hi> in the <hi>Kidneys</hi> by raiſing great pain, may cauſe an <hi>Inflammation</hi> there; and this ſtone is the occaſional and material cauſe thereof; but none can think that this contains fire in it, or is capable to be inflamed, or to communicate any heat to the containing parts, ſave only what it hath received from the vital heat reſiding in the body. And thus it is in all other caſes of <hi>Inflammation,</hi> in any part of the body, from what cauſe ſoever.</p>
               <p>This vital <hi>Principle</hi> is ſeated in every member of the body, and does preſide as Governor; and not only for defence thereof, but alſo to move and act in it ſo; as no vital office or function can be performed without the aſſiſtance and power of this internal inviſible <hi>Agent;</hi> nor is
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49201:94"/>there any heat, but what ariſeth from hence: And this is that which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls the <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum faciens; Helmont</hi> the <hi>Archaeus,</hi> which I chuſe rather to call the vital <hi>Principle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When any thing happens out of order in the body, a Veſſel obſtructed, or ſome liquor extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſated, or what elſe that may diſturb and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt any member in its office; ſoon the vital Principle is affected and concerned therein; and if the matter be conſiderable and contumacious, pain ariſeth there: and this pain is the ſuffering and anguiſh of the vital <hi>Regent,</hi> ſtrugling to reſiſt the injury, and labouring to remove the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment: hence the <hi>Inflammation</hi> and preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat ariſing from this vital power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> and in the laſt place, from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine preceding we are to make ſome obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that may be uſeful for guidance in <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> and to remark ſome pernicious errors that paſs undiſcerned.</p>
               <p>And firſt, here you muſt take notice of the affinity between <hi>Inflammations</hi> and <hi>Feavers:</hi> that moſt <hi>Feavers</hi> do ariſe from <hi>Inflammations</hi> of ſome particular part, and are the off-ſpring from thence, or ſpringing from that root. For the <hi>quòd ſit</hi> Practice does affirm it; for rarely you ſhall meet with any conſiderable <hi>Feaver,</hi> but ſome particular part is chiefly complained of; and as the grief or pain does abate there, the <hi>Feaver</hi> is remiſs and ſlackens alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> you are to note, that <hi>Feavers</hi> are erroneouſly defined, <hi>à calore praeter naturam in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49201:94"/>corde accenſo:</hi> aſſigning the Heart to be the <hi>Focus</hi> where febrile heat is firſt kindled, and from whence it is maintained; when almoſt in any other part of the body, if an inflammation hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen there, a Feaver will certainly follow, taking its riſe from <hi>thence,</hi> not from the <hi>Heart:</hi> ſo that the Heart then ſuffers <hi>ſympathically</hi> by conſent; not <hi>idiopathically</hi> and originally. And whereas I ſaid almoſt any part, intimating thereby, that a ſlight <hi>Inflammation</hi> may be in the ſmall and capillary Veins of ſhort continuance, which may not communicate a <hi>Feaver</hi> to the whole body: and ſuch inflammations we ſee externally plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſometimes, the capillary Veins of the <hi>Cutis</hi> being affected <hi>calore &amp; rubore,</hi> which either ſpontaneouſly vaniſh, or ſoon yield to ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward application only.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, From the denominations of <hi>Feaver</hi> and <hi>Inflammation,</hi> you may obſerve the parity or near relation they have to each other; for from the <hi>Etymon</hi> of the words , they ſeem to import much what the ſame thing, denoting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an extraordinary heat, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ignis,</hi> and in the Latine <hi>Febris, à ferveo:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>uro.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, We ſhall not depend upon Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologies, which are allegorical, and often ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but inquire into the nature and extent of each, and know what is meant by the one and the other, and then what difference between them. <hi>Feavers</hi> are known, and defined by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural heat and efferveſcency through the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49201:95"/>whole body. <hi>Inflammation</hi> is a preternatural heat of a particular part. Hence we remark, that Feavers are general <hi>Inflammations</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations dilated: <hi>Inflammations</hi> particular <hi>Feavers</hi> of a member, thus differing in extent and latitude: but withal obſerve the order of cauſation; Inflammation precedes and lays the foundation, in this or that part there is the <hi>fomes</hi> and <hi>miner a morbi:</hi> a Feaver follows upon the whole body, cauſed only by conſent from thence and condolency.</p>
               <p>Now if all or moſt <hi>Inflammations</hi> cauſe Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and <hi>Inflammations</hi> ſo frequent, as being the certain conſequents of great pain, then two things are to be noted: firſt, that upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance or diſcovery of a <hi>Feaver,</hi> you may ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect an <hi>Inflammation</hi> couched under it, from whence as the ſpring, this <hi>Feaver</hi> does ariſe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the Cure of moſt <hi>Feavers</hi> ought to be deſigned and managed ſo, as reſpecting and aiming chiefly at a particular Inflammation, upon which the Feaver does depend: <hi>ſublatâ causâ</hi>— and when a <hi>Feaver</hi> ariſeth upon this account (as. for the moſt part it doth) then little regard is to be had to the general Feaver, but die ſtreſs of Cure lyes upon removing the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional and material cauſes of <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> in the particular part, the foundation of all the reſt, which being removed, the depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Feaver</hi> falls of courſe.</p>
               <p>Thus all our Diſcourſe tends to make a true diſcovery of cauſes; that when preternatural
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49201:95"/>heat does ariſe in the body and beget a <hi>Feaver;</hi> we may know, not only what to call it, but alſo what to do, by levelling at the right mark.</p>
               <p>But by the way I muſt tell you alſo, how a Feaver ſometimes does ariſe, and not from <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation</hi> of a pained part: and that is when ſome <hi>heterogeneous</hi> diſcordant matter, or ſome malign and venenate <hi>Miaſm</hi> is mingled or got into the blood; Nature, which is the vital Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, raiſeth a preternatural fermentation and febrile efferveſcency in the maſs of blood, for a purification and ſeparation of this exotic mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and admits of no ſedation and reſt until that work be finiſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> and from hence you are to be warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the dangerous and common Practice in Feavers, by <hi>Juleps, Barley-water</hi> and other ſuch like cooling Medicines uſed to allay the heat; from a great miſtake of the riſe of Feavers, and from whence this heat does aſſurge: for, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Feaver does depend upon a particular inflamed part; or a general fermentation of the blood for purification; in both caſes of <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> ſuch cooling Medicines are pernicious, and have killed thouſands: for by inſiſting ſo much upon them, and aiming to ſuppreſs the Feaver by Coolers, (which is not poſſible to be done) thus trifling the time away, the opportunity of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is loſt, and the diſeaſe prevails.</p>
               <p>The errour of theſe cooling Medicines is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent from the inſucceſs thereof; for never was the thirſt of a ſick perſon ſatisfied by a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lep;</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:49201:96"/>but a draught of good drink, ſuch as the <hi>Patients</hi> ſtomach calls for, that is acceptable and refreſhing: ſo that I ſay, <hi>Juleps</hi> are but cold comfort to a feaveriſh ſick man; for theſe cold Medicines impoſed upon the ſick, are ſo far from aſſiſting Nature to perform the work ſhe is ſtrugling about, that they nauſeate and flat the ſtomach (which ſhould invigorate the other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties) damp the power of Nature contending, and leave her languiſhing for refreſhment cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in her natural common drink.</p>
               <p>What advantage can there be in a <hi>Julep</hi> to take off, or any way contribute to the removal of any matter that is the cauſe of <hi>Inflammation</hi> in the <hi>Liver, Spleen, Kidneys, Meſentery, Pleura,</hi> &amp;c. any part of the body? truly none; but that is not all; for beſides the doing no good, it does much miſchief, in ſuppreſſing the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Nature, and cheating the poor Patient of that deſired common aſſiſtance by drink that would be comfortable. But no more of this, becauſe I have enlarged upon this point <hi>pag.</hi> 27, 28, 29, 30. yet it falls in here, neceſſarily to be taken notice of; becauſe <hi>Inflammations</hi> always introduce <hi>Feavers,</hi> which Feaver being moſt obvious and apparent, ingroſſeth all endeavours for allaying that general and expanded heat; but they go the wrong way to work, even pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterouſly, beginning at the wrong end.</p>
               <p>But now to inform what is neceſſary to be done, when a pained inflamed part requires help, take theſe directions in general, which will
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49201:96"/>be advantageous in moſt, if not all particular caſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Examine and conſider the nature of the part inflamed, being the part primarily affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, the foundation of this diſturbance; from whoſe peculiar ſtructure and fabrication, as alſo from its office, you will find what are the uſual impediments that moleſt and diſturb ſuch a part, and how it becomes liable thereto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> You are to conſider what way this matter is to be carried off (if it be humoral) and by what means: adapting ſuch Remedies ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the condition of the part affected, and proper for the removal of ſuch a morbific cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Feaver that ariſeth from, and depends upon this <hi>Inflammation,</hi> is not to biaſs you, or take you off from any thing neceſſary to be done, in order to reduce the <hi>part</hi> primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected, but proſecute directly there, and regard not the <hi>Feaver;</hi> for as you get advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in relieving the <hi>part</hi> grieved, you will find the <hi>Feaver</hi> to decreaſe, and totally vaniſh when that is reſtored. And to tell you plainly, I know nothing you can do advantagious for the part inflamed, that may be injurious upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Feaver, if the Feaver were inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, and had no relation to the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If blood be the primary cauſe, or otherwiſe aggravating through plenitude, make a depletion; thereby the <hi>Circulation</hi> will be more free, <hi>turgency</hi> abated, and <hi>fluxion</hi> preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49201:97"/>at leaſt retracted; for if the cauſe be in the <hi>Veins</hi> or <hi>Arteries,</hi> moſt neceſſary it is to be done; for commonly then a plethory, groſſneſs, or coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation gave the occaſion of this grief; but if it an acrid <hi>ſeroſity,</hi> that lanceth and irritates the tender part, <hi>Phlehotomy</hi> may draw off, and make a diverſion for a time, until other good means can be adminiſtred, to eradicate or blunt the ſharpneſs of its acidity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Set open the vents and outlets which Nature hath framed, and make evacuation, to abate <hi>fulneſs,</hi> and remove <hi>foulneſs</hi> in the whole body, thereby you will prevent or allay the turgency of ill humors that are apt to ferment and move upon this diſorder; and cut off a ſupply of morbific matter that may reſort to the part pained, of raiſe a new diſturbance in other parts of the body.</p>
               <p>Here you muſt procure , and proſecute this intention with Balſamic <hi>Abſterſives,</hi> the true <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartics,</hi> (not venenous Laxatives the common reputed Purgatives) and cleanſe the lower re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the body; whereby alſo you will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and draw away from the parts affected. The groſſer matter being thus removed and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off ſufficiently, the remainder diſcharge by <hi>Tranſpiration,</hi> making an apertion of the Pores, and ſetting open thoſe imperceptible vents, by the uſe of effectual and choice <hi>Diaphoretics,</hi> thereby to attenuate, rarifie, and ſcatter.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguents,</hi> &amp;c to appeaſe and allay: but our internal caſes do not admit of ſuch applications: therefore we are to deſign otherwiſe, and adapt ſuch internal Medicines, and by ſuch operations, as may reach the <hi>morbous</hi> matter to remove and tranſmit it: yet when an <hi>Inflammation</hi> is ſeated near the ſuperficies or extern parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as the <hi>Pleura,</hi> the gibbous part of the Liver, and ſuch like; eſpecially if a Tumor conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed do appear alſo, or any viſible extenſion, then local Medicines may be of good uſe, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute towards a Cure.</p>
               <p>But here by way of caution take notice, That no refrigerating or repercuſſing application be made, to repel and drive back from the part pained; for this may prove of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, as the imprudent adventures of ſome in this manner have left ſad memento's, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the like practice.</p>
               <p>But ſome may ſay, How ſhall we know when any internal part is inflamed, becauſe neither the eye nor the hand can reach there to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the diſeaſe? Yes very well; for great <hi>pain</hi> and anguiſh continuing in any ſecret internal part, and raiſing a <hi>febrile</hi> heat in the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, does as certainly declare that part to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed (in the ſenſe before expreſſed) as any outward ſigns can manifeſt, where ſeeing and handling does or can adjudge the caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> and in the laſt place; becauſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations</hi> do ariſe from, and depend much upon the continuance of <hi>pain;</hi> therefore <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynes</hi>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:49201:98"/>or allayers of pain may be profitable at ſome times, and in ſome caſes; but warily to be uſed, and the times nicely to be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and choſen, as not to diſplace or put by a curing Medicine; for no <hi>Opiate</hi> or <hi>Anodyne</hi> is <hi>curative,</hi> but <hi>palliative,</hi> and for allaying the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of pain, and to give reſt only: for pain keeping the ſick from natural and wonted reſt, does bring great weakneſs and laſſitude of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Since pain therefore and long watching enervates and debilitates Nature greatly; on the contrary, ſleep refreſheth and reſtores much, that the enfeebled Patient then may gain reſpite from pain, and refreſhment by reſt; when the ſick is in danger, as being tyred out for want of eaſe and ſleep, then the caſe calls for <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynes,</hi> and ought to be made uſe of.</p>
               <p>But becauſe <hi>Opiates</hi> and <hi>Anodynes</hi> do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the morbific cauſe, therefore they are not to be inſiſted upon, or relyed on as curing means; but they are to be uſed in caſes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity for mitigation and eaſe; and at ſuch due times as not to hinder the operation of any curative Remedy.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Tumors</hi> have their denomination <hi>à tumeo</hi> to ſwell; and the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>You are not to expect here a <hi>Chirurgical</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of <hi>Tumors,</hi> as if tire Cures hereof were to be
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49201:99"/>performed by <hi>manual</hi> operation: but I ſhall ſhew you ſome differences of external Tumors that require ſuch management, only that you may the better apprehend and judge of internal: for as external <hi>Tumors</hi> do ariſe from internal <hi>matter,</hi> and preſent outwards; ſo hidden inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Tumors are formed of the like matter, and from ſuch occaſions much what as the external, ſave only ſome outward injuries that may affect the ſuperficial, and hot the interior parts: as <hi>Contuſion, Scalding, Cupping, Veſicatories,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book <hi>de, Tumoribus,</hi> reckoning up all ſorts of Tumors as he ſuppoſed, gives in the account to be ſixty one: but <hi>Ingraſſias</hi> in his Survey of Tumors afterwards, adds art hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſixty five more to them, and gives particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar names: but examining the reaſon hereof we find the advance of number, not any way to promote their Cures, but makes confuſion and perplexity in <hi>Practice:</hi> for this variety is not from any real difference in their nature, but from ſome accidental difference between them in appearance; as <hi>magnitude , figure, ſituation,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that the ſame in kind is repeated by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother name: therefore this vaſt number will admit of a great abatement, and the deſignment of their Cures much eaſier and better managed, when all are reduced under a few general heads, reſpecting their continent <hi>matter,</hi> and many joyned together under one name by the union and ſimilitude of their nature.</p>
               <p>The difference therefore of <hi>Tumors</hi> ariſing
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49201:99"/>from the variety their material cauſes, and the <hi>modus generandi,</hi> are chiefly to be lookt it; for from thence is the deſignment of Cures more eſpecially bottomed; but with ſome reſpect to the ſeat or part affected.</p>
               <p>The general diviſion of <hi>Tumors</hi> from their material cauſes (in the common received <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi>) is ſixfold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> from <hi>Blood,</hi> which makes a <hi>Phlegmon.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>Under theſe ſix general Heads are compriſed alfo ſeveral other ſubdiviſions: as <hi>first,</hi> ſuch as ariſe from the degenerate and depraved condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe ſimple and ſingle humors: <hi>ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> ſuch as ſpring from the compoſition and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſimple humors one with another.</p>
               <p>How far I can comply with this ſpecious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, whether it be not more notional than practical, and my exceptions againſt it, I ſhall not declare now, in regard time, and the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conciſeneſs of this Work, will not give me leave to eſtabliſh my own opinion, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diſſenting in this matter; nor is it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to lay open the intricacy of out deſign in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49201:100"/>hand, by debating and controverting this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which relates chiefly to external Tumors and <hi>Chirurgical</hi> Practice.</p>
               <p>And although internal <hi>Tumors</hi> are generated of the ſame matter as external; yet all theſe differences (ſuppoſed to be true) cannot ſo nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and certainly be adjudged and determined; but <hi>indications</hi> from thence muſt be more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and at large, for diſlodging, cleanſing, and carrying off any ſuch material cauſe, that infeſts and tumifies a member or part.</p>
               <p>Since therefore internal Tumors do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves to the eye, for a more certain and exact: knowledge; we are to make judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them and determine, from the fabrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and office of the part affected and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining; which gives ſome intimation thereof, what <hi>Succus,</hi> or depraved and preternatural matter may reſide there: as alſo from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſtitution and diſpoſition of the body an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently diſpoſing thereto: for that <hi>Cacochy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> which is predominant in the body, is moſt likely to be the cauſe or matter of the hidden Tumor, except ſome other circumſtances and probabilities do mainly ſuggeſt another <hi>morbous</hi> matter.</p>
               <p>From the nature and condition of the part affected, you may ſometimes conclude the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> there to be of ſuch a kind: as when the left <hi>Hypochonder</hi> is preternaturally extended, you may rationally judge <hi>flatulency</hi> and melancholy <hi>feculency</hi> to be the matter and cauſe thereof.</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:49201:100"/>
               <p>From the ſignals of a ſerous <hi>Cacochymy,</hi> or abounding ſeroſity in the body; you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, if ſwelled legs or feet do happen hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Tumor is <hi>hydropic.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>modus generandi,</hi> and the occaſional cauſes of internal <hi>Tumors,</hi> they may be reduced to theſe five.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Attraction.</hi>
                  </item>

                  <item>3. <hi>Congeſtion.</hi>

                  <item>4. <hi>Obſtruction.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. <hi>Extravaſation.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> By <hi>Attraction</hi> humors are brought to any part, and there accumulated: and thus pain increaſing heat preternaturally (like a <hi>Ventoſe</hi> or a Veſicatory) does attract from the adjacent parts, and procures a confluence of humors to the part pained, and thereby forms a <hi>Tumor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if <hi>pain</hi> be ſo apt to beget a <hi>conflux,</hi> and conſequently a <hi>Tumor;</hi> then you ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, and often ſuſpect ſuch a product; for as much as pains are very frequent in moſt diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as before proved. Then alſo remember up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ceſſation of pain, there ought to be care taken by proper means, for the receſſion and diſſipation of confluxed matter: and not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine upon a preſumption, that when the <hi>pain</hi> is gone, all is gone, and the <hi>Patient</hi> ſecure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Tranſmiſſion</hi> procures a Tumor, when the expulſive faculty of ſome parts is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and ſtrong to ſend off any excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious matter, and depoſite it upon a weaker, which being not able to expel, it lodgeth there and generates a <hi>Tumor.</hi> Thus the principal and more noble parts have a natural <hi>robor</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49201:101"/>to ſend off their ſuperfluous and noxious matter, and tranſmit it to the inferior and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble.</p>
               <p>Now there are ſome parts that are weak by <hi>Nature;</hi> and ſome by <hi>Accident.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>Nature</hi> thoſe are weak that are deſigned miniſterial and ſubſervient, and therefore liable to tranſmited matter from their ſuperiors: thus the <hi>Glandules</hi> are all weak parts, lax and ſpongious, apt to receive and imbibe: hence it is that the <hi>Heart</hi> tranſimts to the <hi>Glandules</hi> in the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits; the <hi>Brain</hi> behind the <hi>Ears;</hi> the <hi>Liver</hi> to the <hi>Groins;</hi> and the <hi>Glandules</hi> of the <hi>Meſentery</hi> are very apt to tumifie, and are the latent cauſes of ſome difficult abſtruſe diſeaſes. The <hi>Skin</hi> alſo is a weak part and general <hi>Emunctory</hi> for the whole body, and therefore many <hi>Eruptions</hi> and <hi>Tumors</hi> are there viſible.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Accident</hi> ſome parts are weak; as when by a diſeaſe, inordinate living, or caſual injury; ſome particular part, though ſtrong by nature and original formation, may be vitiated, debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and made feeble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By <hi>Congeſtion</hi> Tumors are ſometimes bred; as when a part or member does not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute the alimentary ſupply into its own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but ſuffers it to degenerate there, and accumulate into a <hi>Tumor:</hi> or elſe the expulſive faculty may be weak, and not able to ſend off the excrementitious part, which remaining there may produce the like: or ſometimes the fault may be in the nutritious ſupply, not being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49201:101"/>of a good tranſmutation, as in <hi>cacochymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> and foul bodies.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the relicts of an acute ſickneſs not well cured, by <hi>congeſtion</hi> in this of that part does afford matter to beget internal <hi>Tumors;</hi> and therefore after the ſmall <hi>Pox, Agues, Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> &amp;c. purgation and cleanſing ought well to be performed, elſe <hi>chronic</hi> diſeaſes commonly do ſucceed them, from peccant matter lodged here or there: and therefore upon ſuch neglects or inſufficient performance thereof, we find com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <hi>big</hi> and hard <hi>Bellies,</hi> or ſwell'd <hi>Legs;</hi> ſome part or other pained, tumified, or hard. And theſe are the effects of imperfect Cures, when the morbific matter is only abated, and the ſtorm laid; but the remainder accumulates by collection and congeſtion, to produce a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe of another nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By <hi>Obſtruction</hi> Tumors or extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are begotten: for when the current is ſtopt in any Veſſel, and by the Law of Circulation the continent <hi>Succus</hi> or humor, is ſtill moving forwards to this place obſtructed; the Veſſel or containing part muſt needs <hi>tumifie</hi> and ſwell, as not able to receive and contain the additional flowing matter in its former dimenſions. And this is apparent to the eye in <hi>external</hi> parts, which muſt needs prove the <hi>internal:</hi> for a ſtrait <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature</hi> upon the Arm or Leg, does cauſe the part below the binding to ſwell: and for this reaſon; becauſe the Veſſels are obſtructed by <hi>compreſſion,</hi> that the blood cannot circulate and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49201:102"/>move on. And the caſe is the like in effect, when obſtruction of a Veſſel is made from <hi>coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation,</hi> incraſſation or groſſneſs, or any <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted</hi> matter within the ducture or cavity, to obſtruct and ſtop the ſtream.</p>
               <p>Now obſtructions are generally acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the frequent cauſes of many or moſt-diſeaſes: and few caſes do preſent in Practice, but obſtruction bears a part, and ſometimes the ſolitary cauſe; or elſe obſtruction is very much wronged; for nothing more frequent in <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> mouths than obſtructions; and yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ſeldom mentioned than an internal Tumor: from whence we may well conclude, it is rarely thought on or not at all ſuſpected. But <hi>obſtructions</hi> are ſo familiar and frequent in diſcourſe, that they are little accounted of, at leaſt not thought to be of any <hi>dangerous</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence: not conſidering that this <hi>obſtruction</hi> may, and does often (being contumacious) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a <hi>Tumor;</hi> and this Tumor may cauſe a long and difficult, or dangerous acute ſickneſs, if not mortal: for the progreſs may go on ſtill, from <hi>Tumor</hi> to <hi>Apoſtem</hi> or ſuppuration, and then plant an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer</hi> there: or this Tumor may become <hi>ſcirrhous</hi> and hard; then perhaps <hi>cancerous, gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grened,</hi> and then you know what follows next, mortification.</p>
               <p>From hence it is very reaſonable to judge of the <hi>ſeries</hi> and courſe of many <hi>chronic,</hi> or long lingering diſeaſes, as alſo or the acute mortal ſickneſſes; moſt of which do make their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49201:102"/>by theſe <hi>ſtages,</hi> have theſe commutations and tranſition; at laſt their <hi>fatal</hi> termination, becauſe this latent train of diſeaſes was not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p>But all this while the <hi>Feaver</hi> was the diſeaſe feared, and vainly endeavoured againſt; and the <hi>Patient</hi> is ſaid to dye of a <hi>Feaver,</hi> becauſe a Feaver did attend (the life did eſtuate and was diſquieted) in the whole courſe, and every tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the ſickneſs, even to death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> By <hi>Extravaſation</hi> a <hi>Tumor</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times generated: as when the Veſſels are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete and full cauſing <hi>tenſion;</hi> by thinneſs, heat, and ſharpneſs of blood; or a preternatural and turgid fermentation diſtending the Veſſels: the mouths of the Veins are hereby opened ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and a <hi>ſtillicidium</hi> or effuſion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained liquor procured; which being lodged out of its proper place, does corrupt, inflame, and produce a <hi>Tumor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now concerning the ſigns of an internal <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi> they are not only extenſion and increaſe of magnitude; which is apparent when it makes a <hi>protuberance</hi> upon the ſuperficies: but alſo a fixed heavineſs or hardneſs; or pain upon preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with the hand, does give great ſuſpicion and probable conjecture of a latent internal <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> lying deep and obſcure; eſpecially, and by way of confirmation, when the preceding cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes apt to generate <hi>Tumors,</hi> do concur to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the probability.</p>
               <p>But before we conclude this Diſcourſe of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49201:103"/>
                  <hi>Tumors;</hi> ſomething more is to be ſaid, and that touching a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> and <hi>Apoſtem,</hi> which are comprehended under Tumors; and do ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie only the diſtict and ſpecial condition thereof: and here we have occaſion to take notice of the different ſtate of <hi>Tumors,</hi> and their way of <hi>reſolution, fixation,</hi> or <hi>tranſlation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tumors</hi> do either wear away and ſpend by <hi>diſcuſſion</hi> and tranſpiration: or they recede by a <hi>tranſlation</hi> of matter into another part: or they <hi>apoſtemate</hi> and come to ſuppuration: or they indurate and become <hi>ſcirrhous:</hi> or they <hi>tabefie</hi> and corrupt the part where they are ſeated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diſcuſſion</hi> of a <hi>Tumor</hi> is the beſt that can be expected; and this ought chiefly to be aimed at in Practice: the next to be hoped for and endeavoured, is <hi>diſlodging</hi> of it and removal from a noble to an ignoble part; or to ſuch place where means can better be uſed, and more apt for receſſion, or egreſſion of the continent material cauſe: but if the Tumor <hi>apoſtemates,</hi> the danger is greater or leſs according to the nature and condition of the member or part: if it <hi>indurates,</hi> the danger is delayed; but if it <hi>corrupts</hi> the part, the danger is greater, and more ſpeedy in execution.</p>

                  <hi>Apoſtem</hi> is that degree or ſtate of a Tumor, when it is maturated or ripe, which is called Suppuration; the material or humoral cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then converted into a <hi>Pus</hi> or purulent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and while this is <hi>in fieri</hi> doing, all Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49201:103"/>are aggravated, pain, heat, pulſation, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion are greater: but being perfected, they all decreaſe again, and the <hi>Patient</hi> finds eaſe; but not out of danger in theſe internal <hi>Apoſtems;</hi> for if it be ſo ſeated, where there is no conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient vent or <hi>Emunctory</hi> to diſcharge it, the caſe is deſperate.</p>
               <p>As the humoral matter that formed the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> was more benign and good, as pure <hi>blood;</hi> ſo the converted <hi>Pus</hi> or purulent matter from thence, does commonly anſwer it in goodneſs: for of good blood and in ſound bodies, the maturation is more kindly, the <hi>Pus</hi> white, mild, and not endangering to corrupt the part: but in foul depraved bodies and <hi>malignant</hi> diſeaſes, <hi>apoſtemated</hi> matter is more putrid, ſtinking, and venenous, and does threaten a <hi>Gangrene</hi> or <hi>mortification</hi> of the part: and therefore ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal collections of matter, in <hi>peſtilential</hi> and malignant <hi>Feavers,</hi> Venereal <hi>Pox,</hi> ſmall <hi>Pox,</hi> and ſuch like, are commonly mortal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scirrhous</hi> Tumors are ſuch, as when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent matter does not maturate and become ſoft, fit to break and diſcharge; but grows hard and fined in the part, not apt to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged or removed by diſcuſſion or ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this the word <hi>Scirrhus</hi> imports, from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>
                  <hi>Tumors</hi> in ſome parts of the body are apt to ſuppurate, as in the <hi>carnous</hi> or fleſhy: in other parts, as the <hi>Joynts, Tendons,</hi> and <hi>Ligaments,</hi> more inclined to indurate and become <hi>ſcirrhous:</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:49201:104"/>and the reaſon may be this; that thoſe parts which take their origine from blood, are more prompt and ready to ſuppurate as the fleſh; but thoſe which take their riſe from ſeminal matter, as the <hi>Tendons, Ligaments, Nerves,</hi> &amp;c they are more inclinable to <hi>ſcirrhoſity</hi> or hardneſs.</p>
               <p>But beſides this diſpoſition of the parts affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is alſo, and chiefly a propenſion in the congeſted or influxed <hi>matter</hi> of theſe Tumors: for by the different nature of humoral matter, ſome is more fluxible and thin, participating much of <hi>ſeroſity,</hi> and apt to tranſpire or be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed: other more yielding to a preternatural digeſtion and <hi>ſuppuration,</hi> as the blood that is pure and good: other inclining to be <hi>viſcous, coagulated,</hi> and conſequently to indurate; as a feculent, <hi>grumous,</hi> or groſs blood, deprived of its <hi>ſeroſity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And farther; beſides the diſpoſition of parts, and that of the material cauſe inclining to this <hi>ſcirrhoſity,</hi> there may alſo come in and be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with theſe a third promoter, which in ſome caſes may be the chief cauſe, and that is, an ill method and injurious Medicines, ſo endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to remove, may thereby fix and faſten the matter: for thus a <hi>Tumor</hi> which might probably be diſperſed, may be changed from its own ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and tendency , and become <hi>ſcirrhous</hi> and indurate: as when conſtant or great Coolers are adminiſtred to abate the <hi>ſymptomatical</hi> or concomitant <hi>Feaver,</hi> the matter of the <hi>Tumor</hi> is thereby fixed and impacted;which otherwiſe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49201:104"/>might have ſurrendred unto proper and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Medicines duly uſed. And <hi>e contrà,</hi> by too great Dryers and Heaters, the thinner part is evaporated, and the groſſer remains; therefore <hi>medio tutiſſimus ibis;</hi> good reſolutive <hi>tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> Medicines, taking their turns with the uſe of proper <hi>Cathartics,</hi> is the ſafe and bed way.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>ſcirrhous</hi> Tumors, although they are not ſo dangerous for the preſent, except they be very great, or cancerous; yet they are the foundation of ſome <hi>chronic</hi> or lingering diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which proves very contumacious, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times incurable, eſpecially if the Tumor be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and concealed: and <hi>Hectic Feaver</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times takes its riſe from hence, which if you think to cure by <hi>Emulſions,</hi> Reſtauratives, and cooling Drinks, you will be much miſtaken in your purpoſe and endeavours.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>ſcirrhous</hi> Tumors, ſome are with pain, ſome without: thoſe that have pain are more hopeful (except they be <hi>cancerous</hi>) but thoſe which are inſenſible upon preſſure, are more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, or incurable. Now according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and degree of <hi>depravedneſs</hi> in the continent matter, and from the part affected, ſo are theſe <hi>Tumors</hi> better or worſe to be dealt with. And becauſe theſe Tumors are internal and hid from the eye; therefore judgment is to be given of them from their <hi>ſituation,</hi> and from the <hi>conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> with other circumſtances of the Patients body.</p>
               <p>But although theſe <hi>ſcirrhous</hi> Tumors are thus
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49201:105"/>difficult to be undertaken and managed; yet theſe are not the worſt, and they may arrive far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to a more dangerous ſtate: as when <hi>Tumors</hi> in their variation and degeneration do turn <hi>cancerous;</hi> and this is apt to be in ſuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as abound with a black feculent blood; or a thick blood <hi>aduſt</hi> by intemperate heat: and by how much the blood thus exceeds in this preternatural condition, by ſo much the <hi>Cancer</hi> is compleated, confirmed, and the worſe: and this ſupervenes a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> commonly, as being an apt previous diſpoſition; (but may happen alſo without a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> preceding, from other Tumors degenerating into <hi>Cancers</hi>) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Cure of <hi>ſcirrhous</hi> Tumors, great cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection and diligence is to be uſed, leſt by their delay add continuance, or improper uſage of Medicines, theſe <hi>Tumors</hi> do not become <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous</hi> and deſperate, as ſometimes it falls out ſo.</p>
               <p>Now a <hi>Tumor</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>cancerous,</hi> when it turns into a dark reddiſh, or livid and blackiſh colour, declaring this tranſmutation and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſtate. The beginning of theſe <hi>Cancers</hi> are very ſmall in compaſs (as thoſe that preſent outwards do manifeſt their gradual inlargement) but by time they increaſe and grow big, with <hi>tumified</hi> Veins round about.</p>
               <p>Theſe cancerous <hi>Tumors</hi> may happen to any part of the body, but chiefly and molt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the upper parts about the <hi>Face,</hi> as <hi>Noſe, Lips,</hi> &amp;c. or the <hi>Dugs,</hi> and other <hi>glandulous</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:49201:105"/>parts; alſo the <hi>Womb</hi> is thus affected ſometimes from Tumor there bred, venereal or other, degenerating cancerous.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Tumors</hi> ſometimes are occaſioned from the <hi>menſtrual</hi> ſuppreſſion in women; and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoidal</hi> in men: and when it happens ſo, thoſe cauſes are to be removed with ſpeed.</p>
               <p>Great skill and circumſpection is to be uſed in <hi>Tumors</hi> of this nature; leſt provoking the continent matter, it grow more fierce, eating and ulcerating; and from a cancerous <hi>Tumor,</hi> it become a <hi>cancerous</hi> presiding <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer,</hi> which is worſe: now the ſigns of this <hi>Tumor</hi> inclining to break and ulcerate are, great <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>pulſation</hi> in the part.</p>
               <p>The difficulty or incurability of <hi>Cancers</hi> lye here; for that the cancerous <hi>matter</hi> will not yield to digeſtion or diſcuſſion: and this becauſe the part affected is debilitated and overcome, by this depraved, malign matter, that it cannot exerciſe its tranſmutative and digeſtive power: nor will this <hi>cancerous</hi> matter obey Diſcuſſives, by reaſon of the viſcidity and groſſneſs thereof: wherefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> gave ſentence, <hi>That ſuch are not cured but by ſection or uſtion:</hi> and yet this is not to be done, except the <hi>Cancer</hi> be ſmall, and in ſuch a part as will admit of ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Cancers</hi> external are thus difficult to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged although they appear to the eye, and are ſubject to manual operation and tractation; the <hi>internal</hi> muſt be greater and more hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49201:106"/>where they cannot be applied unto after this manner, with convenient <hi>Topical</hi> Medicines: therefore prevention in time is mainly to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured when a <hi>Tumor</hi> is generated, leſt it change into this dangerous condition: for I find by the deſign of <hi>Practiſers</hi> in the Remedies appointed, that palliation is ſought for, the Cure not hoped for.</p>
               <p>The grand intention to be proſecuted for Cure, is to change the condition of the <hi>blood,</hi> which does feed and ſupply this <hi>Cancer;</hi> ſo that the antecedent cauſe being taken away, the continent will then more likely abate; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til that be done, this cannot be expected.</p>
               <p>The means indicated for Cure of theſe cance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Tumors</hi> are branched into three parts: <hi>Diea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetic, Pharmaceutic,</hi> and <hi>Chirurgical:</hi> but I ſhall not enlarge upon the <hi>Indications</hi> for Cure, for that theſe caſes are ſo nice and difficult, as not to be handled with generals; but from a colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the circumſtances attending the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, which varies every particular caſe.</p>
               <p>And ſo I paſs from <hi>Tumors,</hi> to remark their uſual commutation and tranſition into <hi>

               <p>The firſt is an <hi>ichorous</hi> or <hi>ſanious</hi> matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thin, indigeſted and watry, or diluted bloody.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers</hi> are thus various in their nature, from the ſeveral conditions of bodies, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes that they ariſe from, or depend on, and the difference of parts wherein they are ſeated; a general <hi>Method</hi> of healing, and courſe of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines cannot be inſtituted and appointed; but every caſe hath its peculiar complication of circumſtances, as directory indications to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, from whence a deſignment, method, and adaptation of Medicines is formed, ſuitable to the particularity and different caſe of every
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49201:109"/>individual <hi>Patient;</hi> and therefore I have not proceeded to the Rules and Medicines for Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Only thus much I ſhall note to you, as a grand obſervable in the Cure of theſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers:</hi> That ſuch as ariſe from ſome remarkable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, as <hi>Dropſie, Scorbute, Venereal Lues,</hi> or other malign and <hi>Cacochymical</hi> habits of body; that theſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers</hi> are not to be cured until the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe and evil ſtate of the body on which they do depend, be reduced to a good condition or mediocrity of conſtitution: for the antecedent cauſe which firſt produced the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer,</hi> muſt be removed before the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer</hi> is capable of healing; becauſe of the continual ſupply of peccant mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter brought to the ulcerated part: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore application is firſt to be made there, elſe all endeavours will be fruſtrate.</p>
               <p>And further, the deſignment of theſe Cures, are not to be paralleled with, nor levelled by, the methods and intentions that the common Rules in Chirurgery have laid down; for as much as many of them are erroneouſly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and deſerve great correction and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which hereafter will be pointed out and diſcuſſed; for we have not room here, nor time now to ingage in that Cantroverſie, and muſt refer it to the next opportunity.</p>

               <p>THE laſt and worſt tranſition of this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous train of Diſeaſes, and the <hi>ne plus ultrà</hi> in vitality is a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> being a borderer upon, or next adjoyning unto <hi>Mortification,</hi> or the beginning thereof.</p>
               <p>And although <hi>Gangrenes</hi> are thus ranked next to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers,</hi> and it falls out ſo ſometimes in the preternatural courſe of Nature (if I may ſo ſpeak) yet it is not always ſo; but a part may and does <hi>gangrene</hi> ſometimes before it be ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, for Inflammations and Tumors do gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene as oft as Ulcers: but <hi>Gangrenes</hi> are placed in this order after <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers,</hi> as being the worſt and laſt <hi>morbous</hi> ſtate that can come, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this there is no diſeaſe: for although <hi>Mortification</hi> be ſet down after <hi>Gangrene,</hi> yet this is no diſeaſe, <hi>vita extincta non eſt morbus;</hi> for diſeaſes are ſeated in the life, <hi>corpus vivens eſt domicilium morborum,</hi> and where no life is, there is no diſeaſe: but <hi>Mortification</hi> is poſited here as the center to which diſeaſes move; and as bounds to ſtop all farther diſquiſition.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Gangrene</hi> is a corruption and change of a part or member, into ſuch a degree or ſtate, as beginning to mortifie, or is mortifying.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Sphacelus</hi> with the Greeks, <hi>Syderatio</hi> in the Latine, which we call Mortification in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh; is when a part is perfectly mortified and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49201:110"/>dead: and therefore a <hi>Gangrene</hi> is capable of Cure , but a <hi>Sphacelus</hi> not, becauſe the part is dead.</p>
               <q>A privatione ad habitum non datur regreſſus.</q>
               <p>The external and primitive cauſes of <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grenes</hi> are; <hi>Contuſion, Vulneration, Congelation, Combuſtion, Conſtriction, Poyſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Contuſion</hi> ſometimes introduceth a <hi>Gangrene</hi> by coagulating and fixing the blood ſo firmly in the part contuſed, that thereby the life is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt and overcome: for communication and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with other parts of the body which is requiſite, being thus denied, the life extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: beſides, the coagulated bruiſed blood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining long undiſcuſſed, does putrifie, and <hi>gangrene.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vulneration</hi> or <hi>ſection</hi> ſometimes procures a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> when the vital Principle is ſo debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, or enormous by the wound, that inſtead of a good ſuppuration and vigorous tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, a depraved matter is generated, which corrupts and <hi>gangrenes</hi> the part: and thus a ſmall cut of a <hi>finger</hi> or <hi>Toe</hi> hath gangrened, and killed the perſon: but in greater Wounds, the danger is greater, as more frequently to happen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Congelation,</hi> by extremity of cold, hindring Tranſpiration, and condenſing the blood, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it <hi>ſtagnant</hi> in the Veſſels, ſuffocates the life, and <hi>gangrenes</hi> the member: thus in extreme cold Countries, people by caſualties expoſed, have their <hi>Limbs</hi> mortified ſometimes: and thus a <hi>Gangrene</hi> is brought upon an <hi>Inflammation</hi> or
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49201:110"/>
                  <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> ſometimes, by incautelous and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious application of great refrigerating or cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicines, thereby incraſſating the blood, and prohibiting tranſpiration. And this is very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous, though adviſed and practiſed frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſome <hi>Chirurgeons</hi> in theſe caſes, uſing cold, aſtringent, emplaſtic Cataplaſms; <hi>ex farin. hord. bolo armen. album. ovor. aceto,</hi> &amp;c when an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation appears.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Combuſtion</hi> ſometimes begets a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> and deſtroys the life of the part; when by neglect thereupon, or improper means uſed, relief is not duly afforded: and thus by <hi>Cauteries</hi> and <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtics</hi> ſometimes a member becomes mortified. Now <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſtion</hi> or great hurt by burning, cauſeth <hi>Gangrenes</hi> by corrugating, ſhrinking, and ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Veſſels, that they cannot bring ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of vital Spirits and nutriment to the part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſtriction</hi> or compreſſion procures a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, by intercepting of vital communication; ſo that the member thereby is as it were ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and cut off from the body, and fountain of life: for the parts are maintained by influxed rays and ſtreams of vital heat and moiſture to the remoteſt parts of the body, but being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thereof they dye: thus a <hi>Ligature</hi> drawn ſtrait about the Arm or Leg, and continuing too long, may <hi>gangrene</hi> and mortifie the part, by excommunicating it from commerce with, and participation of the general life.</p>
               <p>And thus ſometimes internal <hi>ſcirrhous Tumors</hi> do compreſs the Veſſels and obſtruct them: of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49201:111"/>this <hi>Fabricius Hildanus</hi> gives an example of one that a <hi>Gangrene</hi> ſeized both his legs, of which he dyed: the cauſe was latent, until by diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he found a <hi>ſcirrhous Tumor</hi> about the <hi>Vena cava</hi> deſcending, between the <hi>Reins,</hi> where this great Vein divides into two parts to ſupply both legs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Poyſons,</hi> ſome of them do <hi>gangrene</hi> by concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and condenſing the blood, ſtopping the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and ſuffocating the life, as the Venom of a <hi>Scorpion</hi> and <hi>Aſp:</hi> others by putrifying and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the blood, or ſome other part where they chiefly diſcharge their venom.</p>
               <p>Internal and conjunct cauſes of <hi>Gangrenes</hi> are, <hi>Inflammation,</hi> corrupt, venenous, or malignant matter, that preys upon, and deſtroys the vital Principle; <hi>ſtagnation</hi> of the blood, or what elſe may intercept commerce and ſupply from the fountain of life.</p>
               <p>The Characters or ſigns declaring a <hi>Gangrene</hi> are theſe: the ſenſe of feeling decays, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour changeth and inclines to be livid or blackiſh, the fleſh grows flaccid and frigid: but when the Gangrene proceeds on to a <hi>Sphacelus</hi> or perfect mortification, theſe Symptoms then are aggravated, and appear more eminent; ſenſe is quite aboliſhed, and the part becomes fetid and <hi>cadaverous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gangrenes</hi> are very ſeldom mentioned in <hi>Practice;</hi> and you ſhall rarely hear of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to dye of a <hi>Gangrene;</hi> yet I muſt believe (and not without good grounds) that many
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49201:111"/>thouſands dye by an internal <hi>Gangrene,</hi> not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of: for if the major part, at leaſt a great part, do dye with a high Feaver or <hi>Phlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſis,</hi> we may rationally then conclude, that a <hi>Gangrene</hi> is frequently conjoyned as the laſt <hi>Actor</hi> in the Tragedy and immediate cauſe of death: for <hi>Gangrenes</hi> do commonly ſupervene Inflammations where they are mortal: and thus alſo <hi>Inflammations</hi> from fractures and diſlocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, often bring on a <hi>Gangrene.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in malignant high Feavers there are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuch <hi>vibices,</hi> marks of mortified blood, and black mouths, which do ſtrongly ſuggeſt a <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene</hi> within the body.</p>
               <p>And for thoſe that periſh by the <hi>Plague</hi> in ſo ſhort a time, whoſe venemous matter ſhews it ſelf by <hi>Spots, Veſicles, Buboes,</hi> and <hi>Carbuncles;</hi> moſt of theſe dye <hi>gangrened.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And many of thoſe that expire by the ſmall Pox, have a Gangrene in ſome part; the putrid matter being lodged there, Nature not able to protrude and bring it forth: and it is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to aſſert this; for, if a <hi>Gangrene</hi> will ariſe out of a very ſmall portion of matter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travaſated, defluxed, or congeſted in a part; then where the whole body abounds with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign putrefaction and overflows with it, any part thereof remaining within the body, may and does very often corrupt and <hi>gangrene</hi> that part.</p>
               <p>That our Opinions are not ſo extravagant and <hi>excentric</hi> from the Judgment of all Learned men, as ſome perhaps inconſiderately may cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:49201:112"/>take notice what <hi>Arniſaeus</hi> an eminent Phyſician in <hi>Germany,</hi> Profeſſor in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>Julia,</hi> writing to <hi>Gregor.

               <p>Now concerning the curability and incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49201:112"/>of <hi>Gangrenes,</hi> take theſe inſtructions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diſeaſe be undertaken, or left for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate and hopeleſs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Conſider the duration or time of the diſeaſe, the age and ſtrength of the Patient; for a <hi>Gangrene</hi> in the beginning is more eaſie and hopeful, than after continuance; becauſe it proceeds on commonly and draws nearer to a <hi>Sphacelus,</hi> which is incurable: alſo young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, vegete and vigorous in ſpirit, are more hopeful than others, aged, or worn out by long, or enervated by acute ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Examine into the <hi>eſſence,</hi> nature, and riſe of the diſeaſe, which will lay open much of the difficulty thereof: for <hi>Gangrenes</hi> from a primitive cauſe, as <hi>Contuſion, Fracture, Section, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſtion, Cauſtic,</hi> or other eroſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are more curable and leſs dangerous, than thoſe that ariſe and depend upon antecedent internal cauſes; for Gangrenes of this ſort do declare a cachectic, depraved habit of body, and that ſome of the internal <hi>Viſcera</hi> are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and vitiated, from whence a ſupply of ill matter: and therefore in <hi>Hydropic, Scorbatic,</hi> and <hi>Hectic</hi> febrile bodies; alſo in malign and contagious diſeaſes, ſmall <hi>Pox,</hi> Venereal <hi>Lues, Plague,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gangrenes</hi> are more deſperate.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The part affected or ſeat of the diſeaſe is to be noted: for if a principal part be <hi>gangrened,</hi> recovery is very rare; alſo in the Guts a <hi>Gangrene</hi> is mortal, by reaſon of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual moiſture there, and imbecillity of theſe
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49201:113"/>alſo in the <hi>Vagina <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>teri,</hi> and <hi>Glandules</hi> of the body, a Cure is ſeldom performed.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the Cure of <hi>Gangrenes,</hi> there is not any one Method or particular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine for <hi>Gangrenes;</hi> but they require ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation of Cure according to the difference of their cauſes from whence they do ariſe, with reſpect to the part affected.</p>
               <p>And therefore we cannot point out any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral courſe that may be applicable to this great diſeaſe; but indications of particular and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial caſes muſt vary, and will make exceptions againſt it: So that the rational Phyſician per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending and duly conſidering the nature of the diſeaſe and variations thereof, as aforeſaid, with the Symptoms and circumſtances attending; muſt deſign ſuch a Method, and adapt ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines <hi>pro re nata,</hi> as may beſt ſuit with the urgency of this dangerous and threatning Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady.</p>
               <p>The means required and uſeful in theſe emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies are taken, ſome from <hi>Pharmacy,</hi> and ſome from <hi>Chirurgery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pharmaceutic</hi> Remedies are both internal and external, Internal are ſelect and choice <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Diaphoretics,</hi> and <hi>Cardiacs,</hi> elaborated and prepared according to latter inventions, and the beſt Rules of Art. Topical and external are, <hi>Fomentations, Liniments,</hi> and <hi>Cataplaſms,</hi> ſpecificated and appropriated to theſe purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>Chirurgical helps are, <hi>Phlebotomy, Cupping,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:49201:113"/>Scarification, Canteries,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Chirurgeon muſt here be aſſiſting, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form theſe operations.</p>
               <p>Now all theſe various means are not to be uſed to every perſon <hi>gangrened;</hi> but each caſe will require ſome of theſe, more or leſs, as the Judgment of a skilful Phyſician in this diſeaſe, ſhall determine and appoint.</p>
               <p>But if the <hi>Gangrene</hi> by continuance and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; or from acuteneſs by great malignity and venenate matter, hath proceeded too forward, and draws near to a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> mortification; then theſe means are to be laid aſide, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remains to be done but <hi>amputation</hi> or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring; and that only if the part will allow it, as Arm or Leg, <hi>Scrotum</hi> or Dug,
<q>
                     <l>—immedicabile vulnus</l>
                     <l>Enſe recidendum eſt, ne pars ſincera trahatur.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And if a ſeparation of this dead part from the living cannot be performed, there is no hopes of recovery or reduction of that to life again: <hi>à privatione ad habitum non datur regreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> Nor is there any hopes of the <hi>Patients</hi> life, for this mortified part will corrupt and mortifie the whole.</p>
               <p>Where amputation can be performed, this queſtion, as a difficulty, ariſeth amongſt men of Art: Whether <hi>Section</hi> ſhould be made in the ſound, or unſound part. Some are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it ſhould be in the <hi>dying</hi> or <hi>dead</hi> part; thereby to avoid pain, to prevent the great <hi>Haemorrhage</hi> or flux of blood, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion:
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49201:114"/>but I rather conſent with thoſe that determine of the other ſide, as the moſt ſecure way, and the arguments for it are more preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, rather to take away ſome of the ſound fleſh, than to leave any of the corrupt and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified; for from that root the ſame miſchief may grow again, notwithſtanding <hi>cauterizing,</hi> or what elſe may be done.</p>
               <p>For a good performance and happy ſucceſs in this operation being the <hi>ultimum refugium</hi> and extreme remedy in this deſperate caſe, there are many things to be cautioned; ſome before as previous; others in the doing, and alſo after diſmembring, to prevent the ill accidents that may attend or follow. But I muſt wave thoſe particulars now, until occaſion be offered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe this Work, and enlarge upon the ſeveral Heads treated of.</p>
               <p>And ſince that theſe diſeaſes now briefly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed, have ſuch tranſitions and gradations, from bad to worſe, and from thence to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; it behoves every one upon ſuſpicion of theſe latent and obſcure Maladies (intimated by pain) to begin early with them, when with a ſmaller matter they are capable to be reduced: but delays and neglects, or improper miſtaken courſes, do precipitate the Patient into languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and difficult, or irremediable conditions.</p>

               <head>The <hi>Reſult</hi> of the whole matter, by way of <hi>Recapitulation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Have thus briefly delivered to you the moſt conſiderable matter relating to the Subject propoſed in the Front of this Work, <hi>Pains, Inflammations, Tumors, Apoſtems,</hi> &amp;c. this fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and latent progreſs of Diſeaſes; which might admit of great inlargements and long diſcourſes upon the ſeveral parts, and points touched upon; but I have only drawn out the chief Heads as a <hi>Compendium,</hi> eaſie to review and retain in memory, whereto many caſes and the moſt principal in Practice do refer and belong, and may ſerve as a guide and caution to <hi>Practiſers</hi> that jog on in the common beaten road, who little ſuſpect this train of Diſeaſes, and diſcern not their diſguiſes in the ſickneſſes they undertake.</p>
               <p>Indeed it ſeems ſomething ſtrange, that theſe <hi>capital</hi> diſeaſes, which moſt other are dependent upon, or move towards, ſhould not be obvious, and more frequently the ſubject of <hi>Practice;</hi> theſe being primitive diſeaſes, and a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, from whence many others are derived and bottomed upon: or elſe they are ſuch, as moſt diſeaſes do fall into, and are the termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them.</p>
               <p>And it is very reaſonable to expect, that both moſt <hi>acute</hi> and alſo <hi>chronic</hi> diſeaſes ſhould go in this road, and make their <hi>tranſitions</hi> by
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49201:115"/>theſe ſtages; for <hi>pain</hi> is ſo general in diſeaſes, and this ſo naturally leads on the reſt, or at leaſt does ſignally declare that the reſt are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on; as in <hi>pag.</hi> 9, 10, 11, 12. is ſet forth.</p>
               <p>And if you do but conſider, that in diſeaſes, both <hi>acute,</hi> and <hi>ſlow</hi> of motion, there is moſt commonly a peccant matter lodged here or there, and cauſeth particular pain in ſome part; or elſe this <hi>morbific</hi> matter is floating in the Veſſels, and produceth only ſome general indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, or a febrile eſtuation and diſtemper: if it be lodged in any part by defluxion, or bred there by congeſtion, it neceſſarily diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that part, gives ſome diſturbance by <hi>pain,</hi> and will form a <hi>Tumor,</hi> if not removed and diſlodged in due time: but if the morbific mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be roving and fluctuating, Nature either makes a ſecretion and ſends it forth by her own ſtrength, or aſſiſted by Medicine; or elſe it is tranſmitted into ſome ignoble part, where it will not lye dormant long, but accumulates there, becomes more depraved, and lays the foundation for this train of diſeaſes: ſo that either way there is a tendency to bring about this deſign, the ſubject of our Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>In the moſt <hi>malignant</hi> ſickneſſes you may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern ſome or more of theſe confederate diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as <hi>Actors</hi> therein, whether ſmall <hi>Pox,</hi> great <hi>Pox, Plague,</hi> &amp;c. for eruptions and ſuperficial <hi>Tumors</hi> are but internal Tumors tranſplanted; at leaſt are the ſignals of Natures endeavors and ſtrength, with or without aſſiſtance to caſt out
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:49201:115"/>that <hi>morbous</hi> matter, which otherwiſe muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily <hi>inflame, tumifie, apoſtemate, ulcerate,</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and deſtroy the internal parts.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Feavers</hi> that are not malign, they are adjudged ſalutary and hopeful, when Nature makes a good <hi>Criſis,</hi> by <hi>Fluxes</hi> or <hi>Sweats,</hi> by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> or a <hi>Haemorrhage:</hi> and if the morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic matter be not diſcharged ſome of theſe ways, it lodgeth here or there, after long floating about, is ſequeſtred and caſt into ſome receſs, <hi>Glandule</hi> or other ignoble part, where it forms a <hi>Tumor,</hi> and is the ſecret foundation of ſome <hi>chronic</hi> diſeaſe, or another <hi>acute</hi> ſickneſs, if not anticipated or prevented by due courſe of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine: and therefore in the deſignment of moſt Cures, acute or chronic, theſe are the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous rocks you are to avoid, leſt the <hi>Patient</hi> miſcarry here, for want of diſcerning and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight thereof.</p>
               <p>The method and drift of our Diſcourſe is, to let you underſtand, that this grand <hi>Series</hi> of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes is the uſual progreſs in ſickneſs; and by theſe ſtages moſt diſeaſes do paſs on, and have their gradual advance by theſe commutations, and thus make their approaches towards death.</p>
               <p>Some go but part of this way, ſuch as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence with good means does ſhorten the courſe, prevents the miſchief threatned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth them back into their former ſtate of health. Some are only pained for a while, it goes off and ends there: but ſome are pained in a higher degree, and <hi>Inflammation</hi> follows
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:49201:116"/>thereupon, but it goes no farther; this <hi>febrile</hi> inflaming heat is allayed, and all is quiet again. Sometimes it proceeds farther, and to <hi>Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> a <hi>Tumor</hi> is added; which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by due adminiſtration of Medicine, this is diſperſed, and the ſick reduced to a ſound ſtate again: but yet ſometimes it advanceth farther and into greater danger; as by ſome neglect, improper means, or other caſualties, that this Tumor <hi>apoſtemates;</hi> and then it cannot ſtop there, for this muſt break, and then an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer</hi> will follow of courſe: this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer,</hi> if not of a very malign nature, or very ill ſeated, is yet cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and the Patient may do well and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by care and skill of the <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctability of the diſeaſed: but elſe this does cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and mortifie the part; and then there muſt be diſmembring (if capable) which is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous and doubtful; or <hi>mortification</hi> of the whole will ſoon follow, which is certain.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee ſome go half the way; ſome but a quarter; and come off well: others that are ingaged in a fatal ſickneſs, muſt go through and finiſh the whole courſe by theſe gradations, or elſe <hi>per ſaltum;</hi> although they may ſtep over, and miſs ſome of them, yet they do arrive at the <hi>period</hi> of mortification.</p>
               <p>I have now finiſhed what I intended briefly upon this <hi>Subject,</hi> having given you a proſpect of this ſecret and lurking train of Diſeaſes; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering them in their <hi>cauſes</hi> and <hi>diſguiſes;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what diſtempers they commonly are vailed

               <p>BY the courſe of Nature, humane Bodies are nouriſhed and maintained, by a continual ſupply of neceſſary food daily to be received in; which before it be aſſimilated and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into the ſubſtance of the body, this <hi>Aliment</hi> muſt undergo ſeveral tranſmutations and digeſtions: in which <hi>previous</hi> diſpoſition and gradual preparation for nutrition, there is a ſeparation made, the nutritive and uſeful part, from the excrementitious and unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: the <hi>defecated</hi> utile part deſigned for ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is ſtill conveyed from one digeſtion to another, for a farther elaboration, until it hath received the complement and full perfection intended by Nature; the excrementitious and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49201:117"/>inutile part ſeparated in this courſe, is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and received by <hi>ſinks, chanels,</hi> and <hi>vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes</hi> peculiarly appointed and framed for ſuch conveyance and diſcharge out of the body, as the <hi>Guts, urinary Ductures, Noſe, Ears, Pores</hi> of the Skin: which paſſages, if at any time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and ſtopt, the detriment and ſenſible damage ſoon confirms the neceſſity of their uſe and office.</p>

                  <hi>Veſicatories, Cupping, Cauterizing,</hi> and <hi>Scari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> are uſed upon emergent occaſions for a more ſpeedy and preſent help, and do ſhew their effects ſooner: but <hi>Iſſues</hi> and <hi>Setons</hi> are planted upon a future expectation, and their effects are matter of time, and therefore they are continued longer; and becauſe they are uſed ſometimes by way of precaution, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are deſigned to be of continuance and conſtancy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fontanels</hi> are ſo called from <hi>Fontinella</hi> or <hi>Fonticulus;</hi> becauſe, as a Spring, they ſend out their moiſture continually: and they are alſo called <hi>Iſſues,</hi> from ſuch iſſuing forth.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Seton</hi> in Latine <hi>Setaceum,</hi> is ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49201:118"/>that which was drawn through the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and remains to keep it open, was made of hair; but now we commonly uſe ſilk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſſues</hi> and <hi>Setons</hi> are uſed for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; but <hi>Setons</hi> having two Orifices, and by drawing the ſilk to and again, do cauſe a greater diſcharge of humors, if the <hi>morbific</hi> matter be brought to the ſuperficies, as in <hi>cutany</hi> affects: but theſe being more troubleſom than <hi>Iſſues,</hi> they therefore are ſeldomer uſed. <hi>Fontanels</hi> are made by <hi>Section</hi> or <hi>Cauſtic;</hi> but <hi>Setons</hi> are always made by a perforating Inſtrument; which being well known to the <hi>Chirurgeon,</hi> I need not ſay more.</p>
               <p>For the nature and quality of humors iſſuing forth, they are divers according to the various diſpoſition of bodies diſeaſed or ſound: ſuch as the body abounds with and is ſuperfluous, ſuch is tranſmitted thither for emiſſion. And that the humor evacuated is not good and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the body, appears by the concomitant ſigns manifeſting the nature of it; itching, pricking, ſharp pain about the place, <hi>Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> and ſpongious proud fleſh riſing, in ſome more, in others leſs; which are not ſigns of a natural good humor, but a hot, fretting, ſharp, preternatural humor flowing thither, degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and corrupt. Alſo any extravaſated hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor proceeding from the <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Nerves,</hi> does move and flow thither; ſometimes <hi>icho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> or <hi>ſerous,</hi> and ſometimes bloody: And ſuch humors as were wont to reſort to, and infeſt
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49201:118"/>any infirm part, an <hi>Iſſue</hi> well placed does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept and evacuate: and although the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that iſſues forth is little to behold; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this evacuation is conſtant, it amounts to ſomething conſiderable.</p>
               <p>From hence we may underſtand for <hi>whom,</hi> and in what <hi>caſes</hi> theſe <hi>Fontanels</hi> are bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial.</p>
               <p>For corpulent and <hi>plethoric</hi> bodies; ſuch as feed high, and live a ſedentary inactive life, whereby a liberal and free Tranſpiration is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, <hi>Iſſues</hi> may be good for them by way of precaution; for they are in danger of ſome ſudden diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>For ſeveral diſeaſes of the Head, <hi>idiopathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> affected; <hi>Convulſions, Vertigoes, Pains, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargic</hi> and ſleepy diſpoſition, ſore <hi>Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Fontanels</hi> or <hi>Setons</hi> may be uſed with bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
               <p>In <hi>cachectic</hi> depraved bodies, and diſeaſes from putrid humors; <hi>Iſſues</hi> make an abatement of the <hi>morbous</hi> matter, and give ſome mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the effects.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Revulſion, Derivation,</hi> or <hi>Interception</hi> of a humor injuriouſly reſorting to an eminent or an infirm part; <hi>Iſſues</hi> are advantageous to alter the courſe and current thereof.</p>
               <p>For <hi>erratic</hi> pains, <hi>cutany</hi> defedations or eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, and <hi>Tumors</hi> in any part; <hi>Fontanels</hi> are beneficial.</p>
               <p>In moſt <hi>chronic</hi> diſeaſes, that give time and liberty for the uſe of various means, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49201:119"/>way of Cure, and gradual ſpending of the <hi>morbific</hi> matter; <hi>Iſſues</hi> do contribute aſſiſtance herein: but in <hi>acute</hi> diſeaſes that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſpeedy help, they are not a proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
               <p>But although theſe <hi>Fontanels</hi> are of good uſe in the caſes aforeſaid; yet they are not to be relied on as <hi>curative</hi> Remedies; that is, they do not eradicate a diſeaſe, becauſe they do not apply to the ſpring where it does ariſe; but they give vent, and turn the current of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor this way, or that way, that it ſhall not overflow to do hurt other ways. They <hi>mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> and leſſen the morbific matter, and abate the extravagant productions and growth of a luxuriant humor, and are but <hi>remedia à poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riori:</hi> So that theſe <hi>Iſſues</hi> do not hinder, muſt not juſtle out the uſe of good Medicines that muſt take away the <hi>antecedent</hi> cauſe, and <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically</hi> cure; by applying to the fountain and riſe of a diſeaſe, the part primarily affected and deficient in office, that is the original cauſe of any producted noxious matter.</p>
               <p>For the right placing of <hi>Iſſues,</hi> that they may prove advantageous for the purpoſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; you are to conſider whether the caſe requires a <hi>general</hi> evacuation only, or <hi>revulſion</hi> and evacuation, or <hi>derivation</hi> and evacuation. If only a general evacuation anſwers your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, then ſet your <hi>Fontanel</hi> in the left Arm: but if for <hi>revulſion</hi> of a humor, it muſt be remote from the part affected or complan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49201:119"/>but if <hi>derivation</hi> be moſt convenient, then the <hi>Iſſue</hi> muſt be near the part affected. Sometimes an <hi>Iſſue</hi> is placed in the part affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to empty and evacuate a morbific humor lodged there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Having thus determined the part or member; you are then to chuſe a fit place for the <hi>Iſſue,</hi> obſerving diligently the poſition and motion of the <hi>Muſcles,</hi> elſe your <hi>Iſſue</hi> will not be ſo beneficial nor lye eaſie: for if it be ſet upon, or too near a <hi>Tendon,</hi> or in the body of the Muſcle, the motion and attrition of the Muſcle will moleſt and diſturb it with pain, and the evacuation will be but little; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt place them <hi>in interſtitiis Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culorum,</hi> in the place or diſtances between the Muſcles, where the extravaſated humors are moſt frequent in their motions and perambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations: and therefore this operation is not raſhly to be attempted, but conſiderately to be performed by good advice, and a skilful hand in <hi>Anatomy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fontanels</hi> being thus appointed for ſeveral purpoſes and caſes, will require a different ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſome in one part of the body, and ſome in another. For diſeaſes that are ſeated in the Head, <hi>Fontanels</hi> or <hi>Setons</hi> may be placed in the hind-part of the Neck: but becauſe they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more in ſight there, and alſo are trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, <hi>Iſſues</hi> may with the like benefit be ſet <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Scapulas,</hi> between the ſhoulders, one of each ſide the Spine: or elſe in the Arm between the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:49201:120"/>two Muſcles <hi>Deltoides</hi> and the <hi>Biceps,</hi> about four or five fingers breadth below the ſhoulder-joynt: and this is the moſt frequent place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Patient</hi> may dreſs this <hi>Iſſue</hi> without help.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Fontanels</hi> in the Back do not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute help to infirmities of the <hi>Head,</hi> but alſo they are beneficial for <hi>Arthritic</hi> or Gout-pains, by intercepting and evacuating the morbific hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor that tends towards the <hi>Joynts:</hi> alſo <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanels</hi> thus placed, do divert and turn off a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion or current of humors that invade the <hi>Lungs;</hi> and therefore ſuch as are troubled with <hi>Coughs</hi> from a deſtillation of Rheum into the Breaſt, and are inclining to be conſumptive, will find benefit thereby.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Groin Iſſues</hi> may be ſet for diſeaſes of the <hi>Liver</hi> or <hi>Spleen,</hi> obſerving the rectitude of parts; the right ſide for the Liver, the left ſide for the Spleen: this place alſo is convenient for derivation of the morbific humor that cauſeth <hi>Sciatica</hi>-pains, and pains of the <hi>Back</hi> towards the lower end of the <hi>Spine,</hi> and about the Loins. The <hi>Glandules</hi> in the Groin are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to receive ſuperfluous and excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious humors, which being readily diſcharged again by <hi>Iſſues,</hi> the current of morbific matter will then more freely reſort thither, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onerate ſuch parts adjacent as are infeſted and oppreſſed therewith.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Thigh</hi> and <hi>Leg</hi> alſo are places for <hi>Fonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,</hi> to make a revulſion of humors that moleſt
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:49201:120"/>and injure the ſuperior parts; and alſo may ſerve for a general evacuation. In the <hi>Thigh</hi> an <hi>Iſſue</hi> is uſually placed a little above the <hi>Knee,</hi> as being moſt fit there for a binding to keep on: as alſo in the <hi>Leg</hi> a little below the Knee, the inſide of the gartering place.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iſſue</hi> being made, whether by <hi>Cauſtic</hi> or <hi>Section,</hi> the orifice muſt be kept open with ſome pellet; for which commonly the largeſt ſort of Peaſe is made uſe of, and ſo continued, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome occaſion by alteration or condition of the <hi>Fontanel</hi> cauſeth variation; and then ſometimes little balls are made of <hi>Ivy</hi>-wood, <hi>Gentian</hi>-root, <hi>Orris,</hi> or <hi>Hermodactyls,</hi> &amp;c. as the caſe may require.</p>
               <p>The firſt dreſſings of the <hi>Iſſue</hi> for two or three days a digeſting Plaſter is to be laid on; afterwards an Ivy-leaf may be uſed, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts a ſerous humor, and provokes the Iſſue to run; and over this is laid a thin paper: but for a conſtant wearing and common uſe, a piece of varniſh or oil'd cloth, ſuch as the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or riding Hat-caſes are made of, is very commodious and eaſie to provide; very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for journies or voyages, where the other is not to be had; and this you need to change but once in a week or more, wiping and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it every dreſſing.</p>
               <p>For the due ordering and keeping of <hi>Iſſues,</hi> you are to obſerve the times of dreſſing: ſuch as run ſparingly or but little, once in 24 hours is ſufficient; but thoſe that ſend forth matter
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:49201:121"/>more freely and plentifully, dreſs them morning and night: that is, to take out the Peaſe, wipe the place, and put in another.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Iſſue</hi> fills up at the bottom, and makes the Peaſe to ſtart, then lay a Groat upon the place next under the binding, which will keep in the Peaſe, and continue the <hi>Fontanel</hi> deep.</p>
               <p>If the brim or edge of the <hi>Iſſue</hi> riſe high with proud fleſh, ſprinkle a little powder of burnt Alum upon it, for one or two dreſſings, which will bring it down even with the <hi>Cuticula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When your <hi>Fontanel</hi> abounds, and runs much with a ſharp, or ſtinking <hi>ichorous</hi> humor that excoriates round about the <hi>Orifice,</hi> and cauſeth pain; to abate and take off the antecedent cauſe, you muſt purge ſometimes with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and good Medicine: avoid alſo intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or often drinking between meals; be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in your diet, eſpecially at nights, and keep ſeaſonable hours for bed-time.</p>
               <p>When you deſire, and the caſe requires an <hi>Iſſue</hi> to evacuate more; inlarge the <hi>Orifice</hi> and <hi>Cavity</hi> thereof, by putting in pellets bigger than peaſe, as Horſe-beans; and if that be not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent you may put in two.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Iſſue</hi> ſometimes at the firſt making will not run well; the morbific matter being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to frequent other places, and having not found this new vent-hole: you muſt then wait with patience for the deſired effect, and uſe ſuch means as hereafter is preſcribed for a
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:49201:121"/>dry <hi>Iſſue:</hi> but if after ſix months you find not ſome reaſonable diſcharge of matter here, let this <hi>Iſſue</hi> heal up, and ſet another in ſome place elſe, where the humors may more freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort.</p>
               <p>If an <hi>Iſſue</hi> runs but little, and begins to grow dry, as ſometimes it happens ſo; then put in a pellet made of <hi>Ivy</hi>-wood, <hi>Orris</hi>-root, <hi>Gentian,</hi> or <hi>Hermodactyl.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When your <hi>Fontanel</hi> is inflamed round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, by reaſon of <hi>Plethory</hi> or a <hi>febrile</hi> turgid blood cauſing extravaſation and fluxion about the orifice; then apply <hi>Emplaſtr. è mucilagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> to the place; but if it continue pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and threatens farther miſchief (as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>Gangrene</hi> hath happened hereupon) then bleed and <hi>purge,</hi> which will empty the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, retract and give room for retirement, and is the beſt way to prevent danger.</p>
               <p>If a <hi>Fontanel</hi> by time ſhifts its place, and ſettles lower, as ſometimes it doth in the <hi>Arm</hi> or <hi>Thigh,</hi> and comes too near the Juncture; then you muſt ſuffer this to cloſe or heal up, and another muſt be made higher in the proper place convenient.</p>
               <p>The cloſing or healing up of an <hi>Iſſue,</hi> not ſubſtituting another elſewhere, is warily to be done by advice, elſe you may run a hazard and be in danger thereby; for ſome upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count have loſt their lives: for Nature having found ſuch a conveniency and help, does expect and requires it to be continued, until the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:49201:122"/>be otherwiſe prevented, and cauſe removed by <hi>Medicine,</hi> or Nature better able to diſcharge and free her ſelf by the <hi>Emunctories</hi> and outlets of her own appointment. Now if prematurely and unſeaſonably, this artificial paſſage be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied and ſtopt up, there being cauſe for the contrary; the confluence of humors then meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gathering at the place, regurgitates back again with united force and greater cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; at which Nature being ſurpriſed unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly, and having made no proviſion to ſecure her ſelf from ſuch a <hi>Reflux,</hi> the ſame preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Symptoms and ill affects, againſt which the Iſſue was firſt appointed, or rather much worſe, will enſue thereupon.</p>
               <p>Before the cloſing up of an <hi>Iſſue,</hi> theſe things are to be conſidered: the cauſe for which it was appointed; what effects, alteration or abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the infirmities ſince; the age of the perſon, whether in youth, ſtrength of Nature, or declining years, and what ſtate of health the perſon hath for ſome time enjoyed, and is now in: which are to be adjudged and determined variouſly, as particular caſes and their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances collated do ſuggeſt: but generally the body is to be accounted in a better or worſe condition, as the humor iſſuing does appear: <hi>ichorous, ſharp, bloody,</hi> and <hi>ſordid</hi> matter, ſmelling <hi>ſtrong</hi> or <hi>ſtinking,</hi> much in <hi>quantity,</hi> declare the body to be <hi>cacochymical</hi> and foul, the Juyces depraved and degenerate, and require the <hi>Iſſue</hi> to be continued: but the matter iſſuing <hi>white,</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:49201:122"/>reaſonable <hi>thick, ſweet,</hi> little <hi>quantity,</hi> not <hi>ſharp</hi> or painful, nor cauſing <hi>Inflammation</hi> about the place; theſe are good ſigns, and ſhew ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of body, the nutritious Juyces to be in their natural condition, amicable and friendly to the body, and permit an <hi>Iſſue</hi> to be healed, <hi>caeteris paribus:</hi> but withal let due <hi>Purgation</hi> ſucceed by intervals, and a ſpare diet for ſome time.</p>
